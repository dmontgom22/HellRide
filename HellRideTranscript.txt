Parking Lot
The carnival parking lot stretches across an open field, its gravel crunching under arriving cars. Temporary floodlights and the carnival's colorful glow light the area, while distant laughter, music, and the hum of rides fill the air.

Cars park haphazardly, guided by makeshift signs and fluttering flags. Families unload strollers and blankets, their chatter mixing with the carnival sounds. Others linger in vehicles, preparing for the chilly evening.

Shadows from nearby trees create dark pockets pierced by the occasional flashlight. Near the entrance, an attendant collects fees at a weathered booth, coins jingling in the cash box.

Puddles from recent rain shimmer with reflected lights, while patches of mud cling to unwary shoes. At the far end, RVs and trailers sit quietly, their occupants watching the Ferris wheel spin lazily against the sky.

Alive with anticipation, the parking lot marks the transition from the ordinary to the magic of the carnival.

The midway is to the south. There is a blueberry bush here. There are blueberries on the bush.

Your car is here. It's a bit of a beater. Inside the car, you can see the seat, the ignition, the dashboard, and the glove box.

You can see a Parking Attendant here.

The attendant has a parking ticket. The price of a parking ticket is $5.00.

Car Interior
This is your car. It's a 2002 Honda Civic and it's seen better days.

You're sitting inside your car. Even though it's old, it feels like an old friend. From the faux leather seats to the crack in the windshield. It's familiar and comforting. There are old fast food wrappers on the floor, dirty clothes and text books in the back seat. There is an air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror. You see the seat, the ignition, the dashboard, and the glove box.

In the beater car is an air freshener.
