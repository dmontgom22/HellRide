Parking Lot
The carnival parking lot stretches across an open field, its gravel crunching under arriving cars. Temporary floodlights and the carnival's colorful glow light the area, while distant laughter, music, and the hum of rides fill the air.

Cars park haphazardly, guided by makeshift signs and fluttering flags. Families unload strollers and blankets, their chatter mixing with the carnival sounds. Others linger in vehicles, preparing for the chilly evening.

Shadows from nearby trees create dark pockets pierced by the occasional flashlight. Near the entrance, an attendant collects fees at a weathered booth, coins jingling in the cash box.

Puddles from recent rain shimmer with reflected lights, while patches of mud cling to unwary shoes. At the far end, RVs and trailers sit quietly, their occupants watching the Ferris wheel spin lazily against the sky.

Alive with anticipation, the parking lot marks the transition from the ordinary to the magic of the carnival.

The midway is to the south. There is a blueberry bush here. There are blueberries on the bush.

Your car is here. It's a bit of a beater. Inside the car, you can see the seat, the ignition, the dashboard, and the glove box.

You can see a parking attendant here.

The attendant has a parking ticket. The price of a parking ticket is $5.00.

>fuck me
Hell Ride isn't that sort of game!

>shit
Shhh! Someone will hear you!
