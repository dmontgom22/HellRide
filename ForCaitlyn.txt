Car Interior
This is your car. It's a 2002 Honda Civic and it's seen better days.

You're sitting inside your car. Even though it's old, it feels like an old friend. From the faux leather seats to the crack in the windshield. It's familiar and comforting. There are old fast food wrappers on the floor, dirty clothes and text books in the back seat. There is an air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror. You see the seat, the ignition, the dashboard, and the glove box.

In the beater car is an air freshener.

Ticket Booth
The ticket kiosk stands at the carnival entrance, a compact booth painted in bright red and yellow stripes with bold letters above the window reading "Tickets Here!" Twinkling lights outline its edges, blinking rhythmically to draw attention.

A single window serves visitors, where a smiling cashier dispenses colorful tickets from neatly arranged rolls. Beside the tickets, a cash drawer jingles as change is counted, and a digital payment system glows faintly for modern convenience. Too bad you don't have a debit card.

Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and pretzels wafts from the southwest.

The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers. Families, couples, and friends form a buzzing line, their excitement building as they approach this first step into the magic of the carnival.

The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. The prices of ride tickets are on the signboard. The cashier has Fortune Teller ticket, Hell Ride ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.

Ride Entrance
The cars that will take you into the fearsome Hell Ride stop here for you to board and then move forward, the safety bar locked in place, as the entrance to Hell Ride looms ahead - a grotesque facade of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering blood-red lights. The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.

A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read "HELL RIDE", pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.

Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes. Beyond the threshold lies only uncertainty and terror. To one side, the darkness looks a little bit darker than the rest of the room.

You can see a Hell Ride car (empty) here.

Maintenance Office
The maintenance office, hidden behind the carnival's bright facade, is a dim and cluttered space reeking of grease, sweat, and faint traces of popcorn from the midway. The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.

The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray - screws and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.

In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.

The walls display faded safety posters, a cork board with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.

Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose - a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.

Exits lead north and south.

Nearby a ladder leads up.

Nearby an Aqua colored door leads west.

You can also see a worn photo and a desk (on which are a coffee mug and a radio) here.

Dark Hallway
This is a poorly lit hallway. Ahead to the west you can see the glow of an open door.

Nearby a ladder leads down to the Maintenance Office.

>w

Control Room
The backstage control room is a plain, functional hub where the carnival's rides, lights, and attractions are managed. Gray industrial walls, scuffed and greasy, surround a large monitor streaming live carnival feeds. Beneath them, control panels with labeled dials, colored buttons, and lights oversee the systems scattered about the room. Glancing at the control panels, you can see they are dark.

The hum of electronics fills the air, punctuated by the crackle of a radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" The worn floor is scattered with papers, tools, and coffee cups. A cluttered desk holds logs and schedules, while a cork board above displays charts and red-marked notes like "Check Zipper circuit breakers."

A flickering light casts cold shadows as the metallic tang of machinery mixes with dampness. Functional yet essential, this hidden space ensures the carnival's magic runs seamlessly. On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.

A dark hallway lies to the east.

Currently there are sparks arcing out from the switch. It looks dangerous.

Crawl Space
The crawl space beneath the carnival ride is a tight, claustrophobic tunnel shrouded in darkness and filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space - the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.

The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.

The backstage area continues north and south.

Nearby a Crimson colored door leads west.

>s

Mechanical Room North
The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.

Circuit breaker panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls" and "Brake Systems". Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.

A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts - cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.

Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.

There are exists north and south.

Nearby an Emerald colored door leads west.

You can also see a toolbox (closed) here.

>s

Mechanical Room South
The south mechanical room is the operational core of the carnival ride, a bustling, noisy space dominated by a massive motor. Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.

Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.

A cluttered table holds tools and spare parts - bolts and lubricants - alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.

A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.

Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.

You can travel north and south from here.

Nearby a Gray colored door leads west.

Generator Room
 The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.

At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.

The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts - filters, spark plugs, and wire coils - while a work area sits beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.

A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety sign that warns, "Fuel Safely - No Open Flames!"

Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.

The backstage area continues north and south of here.

Nearby an Indigo colored door leads west.

>s

Electrical Room
The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.

A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.

In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.

An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.

The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic - a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment.

This room is eerily quiet, missing the ever present buzz of electricity. There are exits in all directions.

>s

Storage Room
The carnival storage room is a cramped yet essential space, tucked away from the bustling grounds. Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.

Shelves overflow with supplies - boxes of light bulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts - piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.

The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.

Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with maintenance logs and empty coffee cups. Above it, a bulletin board brims with ride schedules and repair requests. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.

The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with nuts and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.

Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.

There is an exit to the north.

Nearby a Khaki colored door leads west.

Ride Exit
The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease. Emerging from a dark corridor with peeling black and red-streaked walls, flickering lights cast erratic shadows on the uneven floor. The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.

Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, "You've Survived? For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, "Not everyone makes it out."

A merchandise display glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor t-shirts and key chains. Beyond the fencing, the cheerful carnival lights and sounds feel jarring, contrasting sharply with the ride's oppressive atmosphere.

The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience - it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.

There is a price list next to the cash register. An attendant is here to assist you with your purchases. The stand has an Aqua colored fuse, Plastic Bones, Devil Horns, Key Chains, and T-Shirts for sale.

Nearby a Khaki colored door leads east to the Storage Room.

You can also see a Merchandise Attendent here.
