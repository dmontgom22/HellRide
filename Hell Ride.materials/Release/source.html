In interactive fiction you play the main character of a story. You type commands which determine the actions of the character and the flow of the plot. Some IF games include graphics, but most do not: the imagery is provided courtesy of your imagination. On the other hand, there[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s a wide range of action available: whereas in other games you may be restricted to shooting, movement, or searching items you can click on with a mouse, IF allows you a wide range of verbs.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">What to do with &gt;</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">The &gt; sign is where the game says, 'Okay, what do you want to do now?' You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects. So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Getting Started</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. (You can abbreviate the EXAMINE command to just X, if you want.)</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME or X ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. INVENTORY (I for short) will tell you what you[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]re carrying, as well.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Once you[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]ve gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Rooms and Travel</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">At any given time, you are in a specific location, or room. When you go into a room, the game will print a description of what you can see there. This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the room you can interact with or take, and a list of exits, or ways out. If you want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK (L for short). </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">When you want to leave a location and go to another one, you may communicate this to the game using compass directions: e.g., GO NORTH. For simplicity[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s sake, you are allowed to omit the word GO, and to abbreviate the compass directions. So you may use NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, UP, and DOWN, or in short form N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U, and D.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">In some locations, IN and OUT will also be useful.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Objects</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Throughout the game there will be assorted objects that you can do things with. Most importantly, you may TAKE or GET items, and (when you are tired of them) DROP them again. INVENTORY (abbreviated I) will list the items you are currently holding. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">There are usually assorted things you may do with these objects. OPEN, CLOSE, WEAR, EAT, LOCK, and UNLOCK are especially common.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Occasionally, you will find that the game does not recognize the name of an object even though it has been described as being in the room with you. If this is the case, the object is just there for scenery, and you may assume that you do not need to interact with it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Controlling the Game</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">There are a few simple commands for controlling the game itself. These are: </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">SAVE saves a snapshot of the game as it is now. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">RESTORE puts the game back to a previous saved state. You may keep as many saved games as you like. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">RESTART puts the game back to the way it was at the beginning. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">QUIT ends the game.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">How the World is Assembled</span>&quot; table of world assembly --</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">If You Get Stuck</span>&quot; table of stuck --</p><p class="indent0">Chapter 14 - How the World is Assembled</p><p class="indent0">Table of World Assembly</p><p class="indent0">title (text) subtable (table name) description (text) toggle (rule) used (number) bookpage (number) localpage (number)</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Space</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Most IF games are set in a world made up of rooms without internal division. Movement between rooms is possible, but movement within a room does not always amount to anything. &gt;WALK OVER TO THE DESK is rarely a useful sort of command. On the other hand, if something is described as being high or out of reach, it is sometimes relevant to stand on an object to increase your height. This kind of activity tends to be important only if prompted by the game text.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Containment</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">One thing that IF does tend to model thoroughly is containment. Is something in or on something else? The game keeps track of this, and many puzzles have to do with where things are -- in the player[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s possession, lying on the floor of the room, on a table, in a box, etc.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Types of Actions</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Most of the actions you can perform in the world of IF are brief and specific. &gt;WALK WEST or &gt;OPEN DOOR are likely to be provided. &gt;TAKE A JOURNEY or &gt;BUILD A TABLE are not. Things like &gt;GO TO THE HOTEL are on the borderline: some games allow them, but most do not. In general, abstract, multi-stage behavior usually has to be broken down in order for the game to understand it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Other Characters</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Other characters in IF games are sometimes rather limited. On the other hand, there are also games in which character interaction is the main point of the game. You should be able to get a feel early on for the characters -- if they seem to respond to a lot of questions, remember what they[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]re told, move around on their own, etc., then they may be fairly important. If they have a lot of stock responses and don[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]t seem to have been the game designer[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s main concern, then they are most likely present either as local color or to provide the solution to a specific puzzle or set of puzzles. Characters in very puzzle-oriented games often have to be bribed, threatened, or cajoled into doing something that the player cannot do -- giving up a piece of information or an object, reaching something high, allowing the player into a restricted area, and so on.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Chapter 15 - If You Get Stuck</p><p class="indent0">Table of Stuck</p><p class="indent0">title (text) subtable (table name) description (text) toggle (rule) used (number) bookpage (number) localpage (number)</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Explore</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Examine every object and look at everything in your inventory. Open all the doors you can find, and go through them. Look inside all closed containers. Make sure you[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]ve exhausted all the options in your environment. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Try out all your senses. If the game mentions texture, odor, or sound, try touching, smelling, listening to, or tasting objects.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Be thorough. If you still can[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]t figure out what to do, try opening windows, looking under beds, etc. Sometimes objects are well-hidden.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Read Carefully</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Reread. Look back at things you[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]ve already looked at. Sometimes this will trigger an idea you hadn[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]t thought of. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Take hints from the prose of the game. Things that are described in great detail are probably more important than things that are given one-liners. Play with those objects. If a machine is described as having component parts, look at the parts, and try manipulating them. Likewise, notice the verbs that the game itself uses. Try using those yourself. Games often include special verbs -- the names of magic spells, or other special commands. There[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s no harm in attempting something if the game mentions it.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Check the whole screen. Are there extra windows besides the main window? What[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s going on in those? Check out the status window, if there is one -- it may contain the name of the room you[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]re in, your score, the time of day, your character[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s state of health, or some other important information. If there[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s something up there, it[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s worth paying attention to that, too. When and where does it change? Why is it significant? If the bar is describing your character[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s health, you can bet there is probably a point at which that will be important.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Be Creative</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Rephrase. If there[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s something you want to do, but the game doesn[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]t seem to understand you, try alternative wordings. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Try variations. Sometimes an action doesn[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]t work, but does produce some kind of unusual result. These are often indications that you[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]re on the right track, even if you haven[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]t figured out quite the right approach yet. Pressing the red button alone may only cause a grinding noise from inside the wall, so perhaps pressing the blue and then the red will open the secret door.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Consider the genre of the game. Mysteries, romances, and thrillers all have their own types of action and motivation. What are you trying to do, and how do conventional characters go about doing that? What[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s the right sort of behavior for a detective/romance heroine/spy?</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Cooperate</span>&quot; -- &quot;<span class="quote">Play with someone else. Two heads are often better than one. If that doesn[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]t work, try emailing the author or (better yet) posting a request for hints on the 'Game Discussion, Hints and Reviews' forum at https://www.intfiction.org/forum/. For best results, put the name of the game you want help with in the subject line and describe your problem as clearly as possible in your post. Enclose the problem in the available spoiler tags (highlight the text and click the 'spoiler' button) so that no one will read about how you got to where you are in the game by accident. Someone on the forum will probably be able to tell you how to solve your problem or offer suggestions.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Part 7 - Walkthrough</p><p class="indent0">Chapter 1 - Table of Story Steps </p><p class="indent0"><span class="heading">table of story steps (continued) </span></p><table><tr><td><span class="columnhead">index</span></td><td><span class="columnhead">input  </span></td></tr>
