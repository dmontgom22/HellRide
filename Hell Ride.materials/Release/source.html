figure of Hell Ride &quot;<span class="quote">The cars that will take you into the fearsome Hell Ride stop here for you to board and then move forward, the safety bar locked in place, as the entrance to Hell Ride looms ahead  a grotesque facade of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering blood-red lights. The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read 'HELL RIDE', pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes. Beyond the threshold lies only uncertainty and terror.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Stocks Room &quot;<span class="quote">Stocks Room</span>&quot; figure of RideStocks &quot;<span class="quote">The public square is a cobblestone expanse bordered by weathered timber-framed buildings. The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The animatronics and wax figures are extremely life like. Hell Ride sure lives up to its name.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty  a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The square hums with noise: the crowds taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice natures disapproval.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Gallows Room &quot;<span class="quote">Gallows Room</span>&quot; figure of RideGallows &quot;<span class="quote">The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. In front of him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air  a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the mans final moments. A raven perches on the gallows beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">As the executioner adjusts the noose around the mans neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Stake Room &quot;<span class="quote">Stake Room</span>&quot; figure of RideStake &quot;<span class="quote">The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Gray clouds loom overhead, natures somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Dungeon &quot;<span class="quote">Dungeon</span>&quot; figure of RideDungeon &quot;<span class="quote">The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber[</span><span class="substitution"></span><span class="quote">]s eerie ambiance.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors  one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Guillotine Room &quot;<span class="quote">Guillotine Room</span>&quot; figure of RideGuillotine &quot;<span class="quote">The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowds gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the events gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: 'High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!'</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner  a hooded figure in black  stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioners signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if the player is in the hell ride car</span><span class="quote">]</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Looks like your goose is cooked.

Emerging from a dark corridor with peeling black and red-streaked walls, flickering lights cast erratic shadows on the uneven floor. The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, 'You[</span><span class="substitution"></span><span class="quote">]ve Survived& For Now.' Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, 'Not everyone makes it out.'</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">A merchandise display glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor t-shirts, key chains, plastic bones, and devil horns. Beyond the fencing, the cheerful carnival lights and sounds feel jarring, contrasting sharply with the rides oppressive atmosphere.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The exit ensures Hell Ride isnt just an experience  it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Section 11 - Table of Little Egypt Events</p><p class="indent0">Table of Little Egypt Events</p><p class="indent0">description</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">In the dimly lit tent, you see that the stage is decorated to resemble an exotic Middle Eastern market or palace, featuring rich, colorful fabrics, brass ornaments, and lanterns casting a warm, flickering glow. Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures evoking a sense of being transported to the 'Middle East'. </span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance. Her attire consists of a sparkling, sequined bodice and a flowing skirt, adorned with jingling coin belts and jewelry that accentuate her movements.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing you into the rhythm of exotic live music played on traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. During her performance she balances a sword on her head and accents her dance with finger cymbals.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">The music alternates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, creating an emotional arc that keeps you entranced. Little Egypt relies on the music[</span><span class="substitution">'</span><span class="quote">]s dynamic changes to tell a story with movements reflecting joy, sorrow, seduction, and celebration.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">The performance concludes with a dramatic flourish of a fast-paced shimmy, a bold spin, and Little Egypt dramatically casts off her veils. The dancer takes a bow to enthusiastic applause, leaving you spellbound by the sensual yet artful display.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Section 12 - Introduction to Hell Ride</p><p class="indent0">When play begins:</p><p class="indent1">choose row 1 in Table of Basic Help Options;</p><p class="indent1">now description entry is &quot;<span class="quote">Hell Ride - A ride to remember...</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">Date night with your sweetie: a meal at your favorite restaurant and a night at the carnival. </span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">After a lovely meal, you get into a big fight over the tip.
