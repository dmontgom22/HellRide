            <description>Hell Ride - A ride to remember...<br/>You're a part-time reporter for The Tribune, the local newspaper. Earlier in the day, your editor called you and told you of a conversation he overheard between the Chief of Police and his Deputy about Whidbey Amusements. It seems there has been a rash of accidents and mishaps at the carnival. Sounds like there could be something suspicious going on. The editor wants you to collect evidence and write a hard hitting piece about this story. If you do a good job, maybe the paper will hire you on full-time.<br/>As you explore the carnival, you learn (the hard way) that the Hell Ride attraction is malfunctioning with the potential for serious injuries to the riders. You must disable the ride off and prevent any loss of life... including your own.</description>
