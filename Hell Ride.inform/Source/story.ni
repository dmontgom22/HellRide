Definition: a thing is free if the price of it is $0.00.
Definition: a thing is for sale if it is not free.

Instead of taking something for sale:
	say "You'll have to pay for that."

Before buying something for sale when the money is not in the wallet:
	say "You're broke." instead.

Before buying something for sale when the money is free:
	say "You're broke." instead.

Before buying something for sale when the price of the money is less than the price of the noun:
	say "You don't have enough money to cover the price of [the noun]." instead.

Instead of buying something:
	decrease the price of the money by the price of the noun;
	say "You fork over [the price of the noun] for [the noun], leaving yourself with [the price of the money].";
	if the money is free:
		now the money is nowhere;
	now the price of the noun is $0.00;
	now the player is carrying the noun.
	
The player carries a wallet. The wallet contains money. The price of the money is $15.00. The printed name of the money is "[price of the money] in cash". Understand "cash" as the money.

		say "You catch just a hint of [the liquid of the noun] at the bottom.";
	otherwise
		say "[The noun] contains [current volume of the noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the noun]."

To say (amount - a volume) in rough terms:
	if the amount is less than 0.5 fl oz:
		say "a swallow or two";
	otherwise if tenths part of amount is greater than 3 and tenths part of amount is less than 7:
		let estimate be ounces part of amount;
		say "[estimate in words] or [estimate plus 1 in words] fluid ounces";
	otherwise:
		if tenths part of amount is greater than 6, increase amount by 1.0 fl oz;
		say "about [ounces part of amount in words] fluid ounce[s]".

Before printing the name of a fluid container (called the target) while not drinking:
	if the target is empty:
		say "empty ";
	otherwise:
		do nothing.

After printing the name of a fluid container (called the target) while not examining:
	unless the target is empty:
		say " of [liquid of the target]";
		omit contents in listing.

Instead of inserting something into a fluid container:
	say "[The second noun] has too narrow a mouth to accept anything but liquids."

Definition: a fluid container is empty if the current volume of it is 0.0 fl oz. Definition: a fluid container is full if the current volume of it is the fluid capacity of it.

Understand "drink from [fluid container]" as drinking.

Instead of drinking a fluid container:
	if the noun is empty:
		say "There is no more [liquid of the noun] within." instead;
	otherwise:
		decrease the current volume of the noun by 0.2 fl oz;
		if the current volume of the noun is less than 0.0 fl oz, now the current volume of the noun is 0.0 fl oz;
		say "You take a sip of [the liquid of the noun][if the noun is empty], leaving [the noun] empty[end if]."

Understand the command "fill" as something new.

Understand "pour [fluid container] in/into/on/onto [fluid container]" as pouring it into. Understand "empty [fluid container] into [fluid container]" as pouring it into. Understand "fill [fluid container] with/from [fluid container]" as pouring it into (with nouns reversed).

Understand "pour [something] in/into/on/onto [something]" as pouring it into. Understand "empty [something] into [something]" as pouring it into. Understand "fill [something] with/from [something]" as pouring it into (with nouns reversed).

	if the second noun is not a fluid container, say "You can't pour liquids into [the second noun]." instead;
	if the noun is the second noun, say "You can hardly pour [the noun] into itself." instead;
	if the liquid of the noun is not the liquid of the second noun:
		if the second noun is empty, now the liquid of the second noun is the liquid of the noun;
		otherwise say "Mixing [the liquid of the noun] with [the liquid of the second noun] would give unsavory results." instead;
	if the noun is empty, say "No more [liquid of the noun] remains in [the noun]." instead;
	if the second noun is full, say "[The second noun] cannot contain any more than it already holds." instead.

Carry out pouring it into:
	let available capacity be the fluid capacity of the second noun minus the current volume of the second noun;
	if the available capacity is greater than the current volume of the noun, now the available capacity is the current volume of the noun;
	increase the current volume of the second noun by available capacity;
	decrease the current volume of the noun by available capacity.

Report pouring it into:
	say "[if the noun is empty][The noun] is now empty;[otherwise][The noun] now contains [current volume of the noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the noun]; [end if]";
	say "[the second noun] contains [current volume of the second noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the second noun][if the second noun is full], and is now full[end if]."
	
Understand the liquid property as describing a fluid container. Understand "of" as a fluid container.

"[bold type]Entrance[roman type][line break]The car has begun to move toward the entrance of the ride and the safety bar has been lowered. The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.[paragraph break]A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words 'HELL RIDE' are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though invitingâ€”or daringâ€”you to enter.[paragraph break]Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: 'One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!'[paragraph break]Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: 'Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your lifeâ€”or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!'[paragraph break]Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes.

"[bold type]The Stocks[roman type][line break]The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures. [paragraph break]The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments.

"[bold type]The Gallows[roman type][line break]The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallowsâ€”a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.[paragraph break]Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind.

An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.[paragraph break]Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallowsâ€™ beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.[paragraph break]The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the manâ€™s neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.[paragraph break]Mist fills the area as you move to the next room."
"[bold type]The Stake[roman type][line break]The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different storiesâ€”one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.[paragraph break]A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers' skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.[paragraph break]The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.[paragraph break]Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry outâ€”some in curses, others in prayersâ€”and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.[paragraph break]Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.[paragraph break]As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.[paragraph break]Mist fills the area as you move to the next room."
"[bold type]The Dungeon[roman type][line break]The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime.

Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.[paragraph break]Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.[paragraph break]Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron toolsâ€”branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.[paragraph break]Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber.

A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.[paragraph break]The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.[paragraph break]Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exitâ€”a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivetsâ€”seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.[paragraph break]This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.[paragraph break]Mist fills the area as you move to the next room."
"[bold type]The Guillotine[roman type][line break]The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.[paragraph break]A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.[paragraph break]The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.[paragraph break]At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:'his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!'[paragraph break]The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.[paragraph break]The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.[paragraph break]As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene. [paragraph break]There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.[paragraph break]Looks like your goose is cooked. Say 'Goodnight, Gracie!"

Section 2 - Stocks Room

The Stocks Room is south of the Ride Entrance. "The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.

The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments.
