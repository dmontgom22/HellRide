Definition: a thing is free if the price of it is $0.00.
Definition: a thing is for sale if it is not free.

Instead of taking something for sale:
	say "You'll have to pay for that."

Before buying something for sale when the money is not in the wallet:
	say "You're broke." instead.

Before buying something for sale when the money is free:
	say "You're broke." instead.

Before buying something for sale when the price of the money is less than the price of the noun:
	say "You don't have enough money to cover the price of [the noun]." instead.

Instead of buying something:
	decrease the price of the money by the price of the noun;
	say "You fork over [the price of the noun] for [the noun], leaving yourself with [the price of the money].";
	if the money is free:
		now the money is nowhere;
	now the price of the noun is $0.00;
	now the player is carrying the noun.
	
The player carries a wallet. The wallet contains money. The price of the money is $15.00. The printed name of the money is "[price of the money] in cash". Understand "cash" as the money.

Liquid is a kind of value. The liquids are water, Cola, milk, lemonade, and iced tea. A fluid container has a liquid.

Instead of examining a fluid container:
	if the noun is empty,
		say "You catch just a hint of [the liquid of the noun] at the bottom.";
	otherwise
		say "[The noun] contains [current volume of the noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the noun]."

To say (amount - a volume) in rough terms:
	if the amount is less than 0.5 fl oz:
		say "a swallow or two";
	otherwise if tenths part of amount is greater than 3 and tenths part of amount is less than 7:
		let estimate be ounces part of amount;
		say "[estimate in words] or [estimate plus 1 in words] fluid ounces";
	otherwise:
		if tenths part of amount is greater than 6, increase amount by 1.0 fl oz;
		say "about [ounces part of amount in words] fluid ounce[s]".

Before printing the name of a fluid container (called the target) while not drinking:
	if the target is empty:
		say "empty ";
	otherwise:
		do nothing.

After printing the name of a fluid container (called the target) while not examining:
	unless the target is empty:
		say " of [liquid of the target]";
		omit contents in listing.

Instead of inserting something into a fluid container:
	say "[The second noun] has too narrow a mouth to accept anything but liquids."

Definition: a fluid container is empty if the current volume of it is 0.0 fl oz. Definition: a fluid container is full if the current volume of it is the fluid capacity of it.

Understand "drink from [fluid container]" as drinking.

Instead of drinking a fluid container:
	if the noun is empty:
		say "There is no more [liquid of the noun] within." instead;
	otherwise:
		decrease the current volume of the noun by 0.2 fl oz;
		if the current volume of the noun is less than 0.0 fl oz, now the current volume of the noun is 0.0 fl oz;
		say "You take a sip of [the liquid of the noun][if the noun is empty], leaving [the noun] empty[end if]."

Understand the command "fill" as something new.

Understand "pour [fluid container] in/into/on/onto [fluid container]" as pouring it into. Understand "empty [fluid container] into [fluid container]" as pouring it into. Understand "fill [fluid container] with/from [fluid container]" as pouring it into (with nouns reversed).

Understand "pour [something] in/into/on/onto [something]" as pouring it into. Understand "empty [something] into [something]" as pouring it into. Understand "fill [something] with/from [something]" as pouring it into (with nouns reversed).

	if the second noun is not a fluid container, say "You can't pour liquids into [the second noun]." instead;
	if the noun is the second noun, say "You can hardly pour [the noun] into itself." instead;
	if the liquid of the noun is not the liquid of the second noun:
		if the second noun is empty, now the liquid of the second noun is the liquid of the noun;
		otherwise say "Mixing [the liquid of the noun] with [the liquid of the second noun] would give unsavory results." instead;
	if the noun is empty, say "No more [liquid of the noun] remains in [the noun]." instead;
	if the second noun is full, say "[The second noun] cannot contain any more than it already holds." instead.

Carry out pouring it into:
	let available capacity be the fluid capacity of the second noun minus the current volume of the second noun;
	if the available capacity is greater than the current volume of the noun, now the available capacity is the current volume of the noun;
	increase the current volume of the second noun by available capacity;
	decrease the current volume of the noun by available capacity.

Report pouring it into:
	say "[if the noun is empty][The noun] is now empty;[otherwise][The noun] now contains [current volume of the noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the noun]; [end if]";
	say "[the second noun] contains [current volume of the second noun in rough terms] of [liquid of the second noun][if the second noun is full], and is now full[end if]."
	
Understand the liquid property as describing a fluid container. Understand "of" as a fluid container.
