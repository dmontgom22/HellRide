As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now-one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction facade is to the east.

Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance.

As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically.

At the center is a sturdy metal pole, with a large bell hanging at the top, signaling when a successful attempt has been made. Along the length of the pole are markings indicating how strong you are.  A nearby sign says, "Buy a mallet, strike the bell, win a prize."&#x000A;&#x000A;Spectators gather around, cheering on participants and offering lighthearted jabs and encouragement, creating a lively, competitive atmosphere.

The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[66] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[67] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures. &#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[68] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[69] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[70] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene. &#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupified as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 15 out of a possible 15, in 65 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show.

Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance.

The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[66] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[67] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures. &#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[68] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[69] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[70] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene. &#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupified as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 15 out of a possible 15, in 65 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>

The kiosk sells tickets to the Hell Ride attraction. The line for the ride forms to the south and the midway continues east and west from here. There is a concession stand to the south west. The kiosk is garishly painted in purple and green sparkles. There is a cashier here.

To the south is the track that will take you into the ride. The safety bar is raised allowing you to enter the car. East of here the darkness looks just a little bit darker.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] enter car&#x000A;You get into the car.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] wait&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The car moves forward and the safety bar begins to lower.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Entrance&#x000A;The car has begun to move toward the entrance of the ride and the safety bar has been lowered. The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures. &#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments.

A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back.

A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity.

The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare.

A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown.

As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 5 out of a possible 15, in 16 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The kiosk sells tickets to the Hell Ride attraction. The line for the ride forms to the south and the midway continues east and west from here. There is a concession stand to the south west. The kiosk is garishly painted in purple and green sparkles. There is a cashier here.

To the south is the track that will take you into the ride. The safety bar is raised allowing you to enter the car. East of here the darkness looks just a little bit darker.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] enter car&#x000A;You get into the car.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] wait&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The car moves forward and the safety bar begins to lower.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Entrance&#x000A;The car has begun to move toward the entrance of the ride and the safety bar has been lowered. The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures. &#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene. &#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupified as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 5 out of a possible 15, in 16 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>
