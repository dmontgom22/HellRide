Twinkling lights outline its edges, blinking rhythmically to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single window serves visitors, where a smiling cashier dispenses colorful tickets from neatly arranged rolls. Beside the tickets, a cash drawer jingles as change is counted, and a digital payment system glows faintly for modern convenience. Too bad you don't have a debit card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides and treats. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers. Families, couples, and friends form a buzzing line, their excitement building as they approach this first step into the magic of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. The prices of ride tickets are on the signboard. The cashier has Hell Ride ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a ticket kiosk and a cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems," and "Emergency Shutdown." Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts - cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Generator Room&#x000A; The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Hell Ride - A Ride to remember...&#x000A;&#x000A;In the early 1980's, I had an Apple II Plus computer with 64K of RAM, dual 5.25" floppy disks, and a color monitor as big as a television. And the very first game I ever bought was Infocom's Zork I: The Great Underground Empire. This was cool. It was all text-based. The game described your surroundings and you interacted with commands that say what you wanted to do. This "Interactive Fiction" really evoked in a game what I appreciated most about reading: rich descriptions, colorful characters, and the like. After Zork I, there was Zork II and III. Enchanter, Moonmist, Suspect, and so many more. I played them all with my best friend Andy.&#x000A;&#x000A;Andy and I were software developers at the time and we thought, "We can do this!" So we set out to do this. We developed a game engine with a natural language parser. And it was pretty good. We could support most of the kinds of things they did, certainly less graceful but pretty good. In fact, our parser was better than Infocom's in one case where the sentence was ambiguous. e.g. "Walk into the room with the lamp." Is the player carrying the lamp? Or is the lamp in the room?&#x000A;&#x000A;For fun, we reverse engineered parts of Infocom's game format. We found the dictionary, certain text tokens used for text substitution, the game text. We also discovered the first example of compression I had ever seen and it just about made my head explode. They stored all ASCII characters in five bits! Pow! Mind blown. I had never considered anything like that. Just another hook.&#x000A;&#x000A;We developed two prototypes: Diner and Hell Ride. Diner was about bank robbers coming into the diner where you are a short order cook and you have to save the day. Hell Ride was pretty close to what you find here. I decided to implement it using modern tools. It's pretty good. Maybe.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hope you enjoy it.&#x000A;&#x000A;d.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Please press SPACE to continue.</result>

Twinkling lights outline its edges, blinking rhythmically to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single window serves visitors, where a smiling cashier dispenses colorful tickets from neatly arranged rolls. Beside the tickets, a cash drawer jingles as change is counted, and a digital payment system glows faintly for modern convenience. Too bad you don't have a debit card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides and treats. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers. Families, couples, and friends form a buzzing line, their excitement building as they approach this first step into the magic of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. The prices of ride tickets are on the signboard. The cashier has Hell Ride ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a ticket kiosk and a cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Facade&#x000A;You head west through the midway, the bright lights of the carnival fading behind you as you approach a wooden booth. A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Exotic!" A rotund barker, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him that says "Dime Admission."  The Ticket Kiosk is back the way you came.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers. Perhaps there's a fortune teller inside, offering cryptic clues about your journey or a hidden artifact that can be collected. There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up, pay for, and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The barker cries:&#x000A;&#x000A;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round! &#x000A;Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! &#x000A;She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. &#x000A;Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids - a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and exotic allure! &#x000A;For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[44] give dime to barker&#x000A;You hand over a dime, and the barker nods, waving you through. As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now - one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction's facade is to the east. There are folding chairs organized neatly in rows. The show should start soon.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[46] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[47] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;In the dimly lit tent, you see that the stage is decorated to resemble an exotic Middle Eastern market or palace, featuring rich, colorful fabrics, brass ornaments, and lanterns casting a warm, flickering glow. Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance. Her attire consists of a sparkling, sequined bodice and a flowing skirt, adorned with jingling coin belts and jewelry that accentuate her movements.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing you into the rhythm of exotic live music played on traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[51] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. During her performance she balances a sword on her head and accents her dance with finger cymbals.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The music alternates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, creating an emotional arc that keeps you entranced. Little Egypt relies on the music's dynamic changes to tell a story with movements reflecting joy, sorrow, seduction, and celebration.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[53] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance concludes with a dramatic flourish of a fast-paced shimmy, a bold spin, and Little Egypt dramatically casts off her veils. The dancer takes a bow to enthusiastic applause, leaving you spellbound by the sensual yet artful display.&#x000A;&#x000A;You applaud until your hands are sore. Did she just wink at you?&#x000A;&#x000A;As she leaves the stage, Little Egypt tosses one of her veils to you!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[54] get lamp&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[55] turn it on&#x000A;You flip a switch.

A large sign at the top reads "Test Your Strength!" in bold, playful lettering. The machine's base is made of polished wood, with a polished, vintage appearance. At the center is a sturdy metal pole, with a large bell hanging at the top, signaling when a successful attempt has been made. Along the length of the pole are markings indicating how strong you are.  A nearby sign says, "Buy a mallet, strike the bell, win a prize."&#x000A;&#x000A;Spectators gather around, cheering on participants and offering lighthearted jabs and encouragement, creating a lively, competitive atmosphere. The sound of the mallet hitting the target is followed by the resonant clang of the bell (if struck), alongside the buzz of carnival music in the background.

The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The animatronics and wax figures are extremely life like. Hell Ride sure lives up to its name.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty - a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[153] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. In front of him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air - a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[154] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[155] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors - one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[156] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner - a hooded figure in black - stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated. &#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;*** You have died! ***&#x000A;&#x000A;Wow, you've received 70 points out of a possible 150 in 135 moves!

Twinkling lights outline its edges, blinking rhythmically to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single window serves visitors, where a smiling cashier dispenses colorful tickets from neatly arranged rolls. Beside the tickets, a cash drawer jingles as change is counted, and a digital payment system glows faintly for modern convenience. Too bad you don't have a debit card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides and treats. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers. Families, couples, and friends form a buzzing line, their excitement building as they approach this first step into the magic of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. The prices of ride tickets are on the signboard. The cashier has Hell Ride ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a ticket kiosk and a cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Facade&#x000A;You head west through the midway, the bright lights of the carnival fading behind you as you approach a wooden booth. A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Exotic!" A rotund barker, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him that says "Dime Admission."  The Ticket Kiosk is back the way you came.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers. Perhaps there's a fortune teller inside, offering cryptic clues about your journey or a hidden artifact that can be collected. There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up, pay for, and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The barker cries:&#x000A;&#x000A;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round! &#x000A;Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! &#x000A;She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. &#x000A;Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids - a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and exotic allure! &#x000A;For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[44] give dime to barker&#x000A;You hand over a dime, and the barker nods, waving you through. As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now - one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction's facade is to the east.

The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The animatronics and wax figures are extremely life like. Hell Ride sure lives up to its name.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty - a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[153] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. In front of him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air - a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[154] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[155] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors - one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[156] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner - a hooded figure in black - stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated. &#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;*** You have died! ***&#x000A;&#x000A;Wow, you've received 70 points out of a possible 150 in 135 moves!

A sign reading "Fortunes Told - What Does Your Future Hold?" sways slightly in the evening breeze.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Mysterious Woman here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[104] give fortune teller ticket to mysterious woman&#x000A;You give the Fortune Teller ticket to the Mysterious Woman.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stepping inside, you're greeted by the fortune teller, a figure cloaked in flowing robes with a jeweled headpiece catching the flickering light. Their piercing eyes seem to look right through you as they gesture for you to sit at a small round table covered in an ornate cloth. At its center rests a glowing crystal ball, surrounded by tarot cards and mysterious trinkets.&#x000A;&#x000A;The fortune teller's voice is low and melodic, weaving an air of intrigue as they ask you to focus on a question or offer your palm for a reading. The room seems to shrink, the bustling carnival outside fading into the background as they reveal your fate.

The rectangular arena is surrounded by padded barriers, ensuring a safe yet thrilling experience for riders. The floor, slick and metallic, allows the brightly colored cars - painted in shades of red, blue, yellow, and green - to glide effortlessly in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;Each car is equipped with a steering wheel and a padded bumper, designed to absorb the impact of playful collisions. As the ride begins, drivers of all ages eagerly maneuver their cars, aiming for friends, family, or strangers with mischievous grins. The air is filled with the sound of bumpers colliding, laughter, and the occasional squeal of surprise.&#x000A;&#x000A;Overhead, a web of electric poles connects the cars to the ceiling, sparking faintly as they supply power to the vehicles. The ride operator watches from a booth, ensuring everyone enjoys the chaos safely. Surrounding the bumper cars are cheering onlookers, carnival lights, and the lively hum of the fairground.&#x000A;&#x000A;The bumper cars perfectly captures the playful spirit of the carnival, offering a mix of harmless competition, shared laughter, and nostalgic fun for all ages.

The slick metal floor beneath makes every turn feel smooth yet unpredictable. Suddenly, bam! - another car collides into you from the side, sending your car into a spin. You laugh, recovering quickly to aim your vehicle at a friend across the arena.&#x000A;&#x000A;The thrill of the bumper cars is in the collisions - every thud and jolt accompanied by squeals of delight or mock indignation. The impact is cushioned by the padded bumpers, keeping the fun safe but exhilarating. You swerve, dodge, and sometimes reverse in a desperate attempt to avoid being cornered, all while plotting your next playful crash.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ride is a whirlwind of laughter, harmless competition, and shared joy. As the music fades and the cars slow to a stop, you climb out with a wide grin, already looking forward to your next turn in the driver's seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[110] se&#x000A;&#x000A;Ticket Booth&#x000A;You can see a ticket kiosk and a cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[111] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Parking Lot&#x000A;You can see a parking attendant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[112] test concession&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[113] brief&#x000A;Hell Ride is now in its "brief" printing mode, which gives long descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[114] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Ticket Booth&#x000A;You can see a ticket kiosk and a cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[115] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Concession Stand&#x000A;The concession stand, perched along the midway, is a colorful and bustling hub. Painted in bright reds, blues, and yellows, it features bold lettering announcing treats like "SODA! POPCORN! CANDY APPLES!" Strings of twinkling lights frame the stand, making it a glowing beacon amid the carnival excitement.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the counter, a popcorn machine churns out golden kernels, filling the air with a buttery aroma. Candy apples gleam under the lights, and cotton candy machines spin fluffy clouds of pink and blue. Warm pretzels sit under a heat lamp, their buttery, salted scent mingling with the sugary treats. A cooler holds sodas, their colorful labels visible through the frosted glass.&#x000A;&#x000A;The counter is lively with stacks of paper bags, napkins, and cups of cheese and sugar sprinkles. A handwritten chalkboard menu lists prices in playful lettering. Workers in colorful aprons quickly hand out snacks, their movements efficient amid the cheerful chaos.&#x000A;&#x000A;In front of the stand, kids tug at their parents, teens share pretzels, and the crowd buzzes with energy. More than just a snack stop, the stand is a sensory delight, adding flavor and charm to the carnival experience.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a menu to the right of the window.

The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read "HELL RIDE", pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes.

The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray - rusty wrenches, screws, and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls display faded safety posters, a cork board with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose - a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;Exits lead north and south.

Gray industrial walls, scuffed and greasy, surround a large monitor streaming live carnival feeds. Beneath them, control panels with labeled dials, colored buttons, and lights oversee the systems scattered about the room. Glancing that the control panels, you can see they are dark.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics fills the air, punctuated by the crackle of a radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" The worn floor is scattered with papers, tools, and coffee cups. A cluttered desk holds logs and schedules, while a cork board above displays charts and red-marked notes like "Check Zipper circuit breakers."&#x000A;&#x000A;A flickering light casts cold shadows as the metallic tang of machinery mixes with dampness. Functional yet essential, this hidden space ensures the carnival's magic runs seamlessly.

The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space - the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;The backstage area continues north and south. There is a door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You sing along to Bruce Springsteen's "Born To Run".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[167] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems," and "Emergency Shutdown." Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts - cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.&#x000A;&#x000A;There are exists north and south.

Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cluttered table holds tools and spare parts - wrenches, bolts, and lubricants - alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can travel north and south from here. There is a door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[171] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A; The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.&#x000A;&#x000A;The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts - filters, spark plugs, and wire coils - while tools lie scattered on a workbench beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety poster that warns, "Fuel Safely - No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;The backstage area continues north and south of here. There is a wooden door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[172] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.&#x000A;&#x000A;In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.&#x000A;&#x000A;The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic - a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment.&#x000A;&#x000A;This room is eerily quiet, missing the ever present buzz of electricity.

The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The animatronics and wax figures are extremely life like. Hell Ride sure lives up to its name.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty - a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads east to the Maintenance Office.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[186] l under stocks&#x000A;You find the emerald colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[187] take emerald&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[188] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads west to the Stocks Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads up to the Dark Hallway.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk are a coffee mug and a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a worn photo here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, you can hear "No Woman, No Cry" by Bob Marley.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[189] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear Kermit the Frog's "Rainbow Connection" playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[190] w&#x000A;(first opening the crimson colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the crimson colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. In front of him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air - a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads east to the Crawl Space.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[191] l under platform&#x000A;You find the khaki colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[192] take khaki fuse&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[193] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads west to the Gallows Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, you can hear "Respect" by Aretha Franklin.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[194] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;Nearby an emerald colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[195] w&#x000A;(first opening the emerald colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the emerald colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an emerald colored door leads east to the Mechanical Room North.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a pyre here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[196] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is a quartz colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[197] get fuse&#x000A;(the quartz colored fuse)&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[198] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;Nearby an emerald colored door leads west to the Stake Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[199] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[200] w&#x000A;(first opening the gray colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the gray colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors - one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads east to the Mechanical Room South.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[201] l under seat&#x000A;You find the indigo colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[202] take indigo fuse&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[203] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads west to the Dungeon.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[204] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[205] w&#x000A;(first opening the indigo colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the indigo colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner - a hooded figure in black - stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated. &#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads east to the Generator Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[206] l under platform&#x000A;You find the gray colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[207] take gray fuse&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[208] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads west to the Guillotine Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[209] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[210] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a cramped yet essential space, tucked away from the bustling grounds. Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves overflow with supplies - boxes of light bulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts - piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with maintenance logs, tools, and empty coffee cups. Above it, a cork board brims with ride schedules, repair requests, and notes. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with bolts, screws, and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is an exit to the north and a door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a khaki colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[211] w&#x000A;(first opening the khaki colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the khaki colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease. Emerging from a dark corridor with peeling black and red-streaked walls, flickering lights cast erratic shadows on the uneven floor. The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, "Not everyone makes it out."&#x000A;&#x000A;A merchandise stand glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor t-shirts and devil horns. Beyond the fencing, the cheerful carnival lights and sounds feel jarring, contrasting sharply with the ride's oppressive atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience - it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a khaki colored door leads east to the Storage Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[212] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand are an aqua colored fuse, plastic bones, devil horns, and a t-shirt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[213] buy aqua fuse&#x000A;You fork over $3.50 for the aqua colored fuse, leaving yourself with $3.50.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[214] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;Nearby a khaki colored door leads west to the Ride Exit.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[215] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[216] test b3&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[217] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[218] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[219] put aqua fuse in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the aqua fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[220] flip switch&#x000A;You switch Electrical Panel 1's switch on.&#x000A;&#x000A;The aqua indicator's light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[221] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[222] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet Three.

Beside the tickets, a cash drawer jingles as change is counted, and a digital payment system glows faintly for modern convenience. Too bad you don't have a debit card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides and treats. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers. Families, couples, and friends form a buzzing line, their excitement building as they approach this first step into the magic of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues in all directions from here.

A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Exotic!" A rotund barker, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him that says "Dime Admission."  The Ticket Kiosk is back the way you came.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers. Perhaps there's a fortune teller inside, offering cryptic clues about your journey or a hidden artifact that can be collected. There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up, pay for, and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The barker cries:&#x000A;&#x000A;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round! &#x000A;Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! &#x000A;She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. &#x000A;Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids - a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and exotic allure! &#x000A;For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[44] give dime to barker&#x000A;You hand over a dime, and the barker nods, waving you through. As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now - one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction's facade is to the east.

The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read "HELL RIDE", pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes. Beyond the threshold lies only uncertainty and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Hell Ride car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[150] e&#x000A;Dark Passage&#x000A;This room is backstage at the Hell Ride attraction.

The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray - rusty wrenches, screws, and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls display faded safety posters, a cork board with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose - a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;Exits lead north and south. There is a door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads up.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk are a coffee mug and a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a worn photo here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[155] turn on radio&#x000A;You switch the radio on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You whistle along to "Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[156] u&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark Hallway&#x000A;This is a poorly lit hallway. Ahead to the west you can see the glow of an open door.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads down to the Maintenance Office.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Losing My Religion" by R.E.M. plays on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[157] w&#x000A;Control Room&#x000A;The backstage control room is a plain, functional hub where the carnival's rides, lights, and attractions are managed. Gray industrial walls, scuffed and greasy, surround a large monitor streaming live carnival feeds. Beneath them, control panels with labeled dials, colored buttons, and lights oversee the systems scattered about the room. Glancing that the control panels, you can see they are dark.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics fills the air, punctuated by the crackle of a radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" The worn floor is scattered with papers, tools, and coffee cups. A cluttered desk holds logs and schedules, while a cork board above displays charts and red-marked notes like "Check Zipper circuit breakers."&#x000A;&#x000A;A flickering light casts cold shadows as the metallic tang of machinery mixes with dampness. Functional yet essential, this hidden space ensures the carnival's magic runs seamlessly. On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.&#x000A;&#x000A;A dark hallway lies to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a big switch and a cluttered desk here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The DJ announces that "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley will be up next.&#x000A; Yes, you have been Rick Rolled!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[158] flip switch&#x000A;You switch the big switch off.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, you can hear "Happy" by Pharell.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[159] push switch&#x000A;You switch the big switch on.&#x000A;&#x000A;The DJ announces that "Tracks Of My Tears" by Smokey Robinson will be up next.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[160] push switch&#x000A;You switch the big switch off.&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear Led Zeppelin's "Fool In The Rain" playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[161] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark Hallway&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads down to the Maintenance Office.&#x000A;&#x000A;You whistle along to "Losing My Religion" by R.E.M..&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[162] d&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads up to the Dark Hallway.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk are a coffee mug and a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a worn photo here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Fool In The Rain" by Led Zeppelin plays on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[163] l at desk&#x000A;It's a desk. There are coffee stains and cigarette burns from years of abuse. The single drawer is shut.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk are a coffee mug and a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear Paul Simon's "Kodachrome" playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[164] open drawer&#x000A;You open the drawer, revealing scissors, a stapler, a ballpoint pen, and a pad of paper.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen plays on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[165] get all from the drawer&#x000A;scissors: Taken.&#x000A;stapler: Taken.&#x000A;ballpoint pen: Taken.&#x000A;pad of paper: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;The DJ announces that "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley will be up next.&#x000A; Yes, you have been Rick Rolled!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[166] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;The crawl space beneath the carnival ride is a tight, claustrophobic tunnel shrouded in darkness and filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space - the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;The backstage area continues north and south. There is a door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You sing along to Bruce Springsteen's "Born To Run".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[167] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems," and "Emergency Shutdown." Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts - cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.&#x000A;&#x000A;There are exists north and south. There is a wooden door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an emerald colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[168] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel lock, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[169] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel lock: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[170] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the operational core of the carnival ride, a bustling, noisy space dominated by a massive motor. Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cluttered table holds tools and spare parts - wrenches, bolts, and lubricants - alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can travel north and south from here. There is a door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[171] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A; The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.&#x000A;&#x000A;The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts - filters, spark plugs, and wire coils - while tools lie scattered on a workbench beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety poster that warns, "Fuel Safely - No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;The backstage area continues north and south of here. There is a wooden door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[172] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.&#x000A;&#x000A;In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.&#x000A;&#x000A;The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic - a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment.&#x000A;&#x000A;This room is eerily quiet, missing the ever present buzz of electricity. There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[173] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet One.

The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The animatronics and wax figures are extremely life like. Hell Ride sure lives up to its name.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty - a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads east to the Maintenance Office.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[186] l under stocks&#x000A;You find the emerald colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[187] take emerald&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[188] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads west to the Stocks Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads up to the Dark Hallway.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk are a coffee mug and a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a worn photo here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, you can hear "No Woman, No Cry" by Bob Marley.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[189] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear Kermit the Frog's "Rainbow Connection" playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[190] w&#x000A;(first opening the crimson colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the crimson colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. In front of him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air - a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads east to the Crawl Space.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[191] l under platform&#x000A;You find the khaki colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[192] take khaki fuse&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[193] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads west to the Gallows Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, you can hear "Respect" by Aretha Franklin.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[194] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;Nearby an emerald colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[195] w&#x000A;(first opening the emerald colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the emerald colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an emerald colored door leads east to the Mechanical Room North.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a pyre here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[196] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is a quartz colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[197] get fuse&#x000A;(the quartz colored fuse)&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[198] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;Nearby an emerald colored door leads west to the Stake Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[199] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[200] w&#x000A;(first opening the gray colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the gray colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors - one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads east to the Mechanical Room South.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[201] l under seat&#x000A;You find the indigo colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[202] take indigo fuse&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[203] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;Nearby a gray colored door leads west to the Dungeon.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[204] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[205] w&#x000A;(first opening the indigo colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the indigo colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner - a hooded figure in black - stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated. &#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads east to the Generator Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[206] l under platform&#x000A;You find the gray colored fuse!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[207] take gray fuse&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[208] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;Nearby an indigo colored door leads west to the Guillotine Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[209] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[210] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a cramped yet essential space, tucked away from the bustling grounds. Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves overflow with supplies - boxes of light bulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts - piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with maintenance logs, tools, and empty coffee cups. Above it, a cork board brims with ride schedules, repair requests, and notes. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with bolts, screws, and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is an exit to the north and a door to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a khaki colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[211] w&#x000A;(first opening the khaki colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the khaki colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease. Emerging from a dark corridor with peeling black and red-streaked walls, flickering lights cast erratic shadows on the uneven floor. The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, "Not everyone makes it out."&#x000A;&#x000A;A merchandise stand glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor t-shirts and devil horns. Beyond the fencing, the cheerful carnival lights and sounds feel jarring, contrasting sharply with the ride's oppressive atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience - it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a khaki colored door leads east to the Storage Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[212] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand are an aqua colored fuse, plastic bones, devil horns, and a t-shirt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[213] buy aqua fuse&#x000A;You fork over $3.50 for the aqua colored fuse, leaving yourself with $3.50.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[214] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;Nearby a khaki colored door leads west to the Ride Exit.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[215] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[216] test b3&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[217] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[218] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[219] put aqua fuse in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the aqua fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[220] flip switch&#x000A;You switch Electrical Panel 1's switch on.&#x000A;&#x000A;The aqua indicator's light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[221] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[222] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet Three.

The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The animatronics and wax figures are extremely life like.

At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. In front of him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air - a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread.

At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors - one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room... &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner - a hooded figure in black - stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated. &#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty.

Too bad you don't have a debit card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides and treats. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers.

The Ticket Kiosk is back the way you came.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers.
