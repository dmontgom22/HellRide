And the very first game I ever bought was Infocom's Zork I: The Great Underground Empire. This was cool. It was all text-based. The game described your surroundings and you interacted with commands that say what you wanted to do. This "Interactive Fiction" really evoked in a game what I appreciated most about reading: rich descriptions, colorful characters, and the like. After Zork I, there was Zork II and III. Enchanter, Moonmist, Suspect, and so many more. I played them all with my best friend Andy.&#x000A;&#x000A;Andy and I were software developers at the time and we thought, "We can do this!" So we set out to do this. We developed a game engine with a natural language parser. And it was pretty good. We could support most of the kinds of things they did, certainly less graceful but pretty good.&#x000A;&#x000A;For fun, we reverse engineered parts of Infocom's game format. We found the dictionary, certain text tokens used for text substitution, the game text. We also discovered the first example of compression I had ever seen and it just about made my head explode. They stored all ASCII characters in five bits! Pow! Mind blown. I had never considered anything like that. Just another hook.&#x000A;&#x000A;We developed two prototypes: Diner and Hell Ride. Diner was about bank robbers coming into the diner where you are a short order cook and you have to save the day. Hell Ride was pretty close to what you find here.

A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.&#x000A;&#x000A;A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. The floor is gritty with dust and scattered nails. Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose and keeps the carnival running, fueled by sweat and ingenuity.&#x000A;&#x000A;Exits lead north and south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads up to Dark Hallway.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads west to the Stocks Room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a worn photo and a desk (on which are a coffee mug and a radio) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;south</commentary>

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">You switch the indigo button on.&#x000A;&#x000A;The monitor flickers for a second and the scene it displays changes to something different.&#x000A;The monitor now shows a tableau of a guillotine rising and falling over the ride exit.&#x000A;The indigo light is now on.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you push the indigo button, the monitor switches to a view of the guillotine room. You still see the blade rising and falling over the cars. Suddenly, the blade starts slowing down, taking longer and longer to fall. Until it finally comes to a complete rest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is heavy with uneasy silence. Hell Ride, once a thrilling spectacle, now looms motionless, as the guillotine blade is frozen halfway down its track. Moments ago, chaos erupted as the malfunctioning mechanism sent the blade crashing unpredictably, ripping through the roofs of cars on the track.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single car, its roof gashed open, sits under the still blade - a grim reminder of the disaster narrowly averted. Above, a black crow lands on the guillotine's frame, its sharp caw cutting through the murmurs of anger and fear.&#x000A;&#x000A;Two mechanics climb the scaffolding with tools in hand, their appearance met with wary hope. A crowd has gathered and is watching, holding their breath, as the cursed ride's fate hangs in the balance. After a moment, applause rises from the assembled crowd, cheering your accomplishment.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mr. Whidbey, the Mayor, the Chief of Police, and the janitor arrive on the scene and extend their gratitude for saving the day, not to mention lives!&#x000A;&#x000A;"But wait", you say, "There is more afoot here than meets the eye. I think we need to talk to Mr Whidbey some more... confront him about a few things. Accusations might be made."&#x000A;&#x000A;Mr Whidbey exclaims, "Accusations?

There is an air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror.&#x000A;&#x000A;In the beater car is an air freshener.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] l at seat&#x000A;A faux leather seat that looked great when it was new.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] l under seat&#x000A;You find the three quarters, the nickel, the five dimes, and your keys!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] get all dimes&#x000A;dime: Taken.&#x000A;dime: Taken.&#x000A;dime: Taken.&#x000A;dime: Taken.&#x000A;dime: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] get keys&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[25] open glove box&#x000A;(first unlocking the glove box)&#x000A;(with your keys)&#x000A;You open the glove box, revealing a 14" long piece of string and a pair of gloves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] get string&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[27] get gloves&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] wear gloves&#x000A;You put on the pair of gloves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] set stub on the dashboard&#x000A;You put the parking stub on the dashboard.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[30] l at the dashboard&#x000A;On the dashboard is a parking stub.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[31] get air freshener&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[32] look at it&#x000A;This is one of those air fresheners that are shaped like a pine tree and smell like one too.

Ahead, the grotesque entrance looms - a twisted metal archway adorned with spikes, skulls, and flickering blood-red lights. A faint sulfuric smell mixes with the scent of popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;The "HELL RIDE" sign pulses above the door, while demon statues with clawed hands seem to beckon. The entrance is shrouded in darkness, broken only by eerie green flashes that reveal twisted paths. Faint whispers and distant organ music grow louder. To one side, the darkness looks a little bit darker than the rest of the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Hell Ride car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark Passage&#x000A;This room is backstage at the Hell Ride attraction.

A strong, narrow beam of light shines from the lit flashlight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The maintenance office is a dim, cluttered space, filled with the smells of grease, sweat, and popcorn. Disorganized shelves are lined with tools and parts, while paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches. A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.&#x000A;&#x000A;A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. The floor is gritty with dust and scattered nails. Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose and keeps the carnival running, fueled by sweat and ingenuity.&#x000A;&#x000A;Exits lead north and south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads up.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a worn photo and a desk (on which are a coffee mug and a radio) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] u&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark Hallway&#x000A;This is a poorly lit hallway.

A large monitor shows live feeds while control panels with dials, buttons, and lights manage the rides and systems. The panels remain oddly dark.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics is interrupted by a crackling radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" Papers, tools, and coffee cups clutter the floor. A desk holds logs and schedules, and a corkboard displays charts and red-marked notes, including one that says "Check Zipper circuit breakers."&#x000A;&#x000A;A single light casts harsh shadows, and the air smells of lubricant and burnt wires, mingling with dampness. The room is hidden but vital, keeping the carnival running. On one wall, a switch sparks with blue and white arcs.&#x000A;&#x000A;On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a metal door leads east to Dark Hallway.&#x000A;&#x000A;Currently there are sparks arcing out from the switch.

Ahead, the grotesque entrance looms - a twisted metal archway adorned with spikes, skulls, and flickering blood-red lights. A faint sulfuric smell mixes with the scent of popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;The "HELL RIDE" sign pulses above the door, while demon statues with clawed hands seem to beckon. The entrance is shrouded in darkness, broken only by eerie green flashes that reveal twisted paths. Faint whispers and distant organ music grow louder. To one side, the darkness looks a little bit darker than the rest of the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Hell Ride car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark Passage&#x000A;This room is backstage at the Hell Ride attraction. The room is littered with bags of trash, piles of junk, and dust bunnies so large they should be paying rent.

A strong, narrow beam of light shines from the lit flashlight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The maintenance office is a dim, cluttered space, filled with the smells of grease, sweat, and popcorn. Disorganized shelves are lined with tools and parts, while paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches. A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.&#x000A;&#x000A;A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. The floor is gritty with dust and scattered nails. Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose and keeps the carnival running, fueled by sweat and ingenuity.&#x000A;&#x000A;Exits lead north and south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a ladder leads up.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby an aqua colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a worn photo and a desk (on which are a coffee mug and a radio) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] u&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark Hallway&#x000A;This is a poorly lit hallway.

A large monitor shows live feeds while control panels with dials, buttons, and lights manage the rides and systems. The panels remain oddly dark.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics is interrupted by a crackling radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" Papers, tools, and coffee cups clutter the floor. A desk holds logs and schedules, and a corkboard displays charts and red-marked notes, including one that says "Check Zipper circuit breakers."&#x000A;&#x000A;A single light casts harsh shadows, and the air smells of lubricant and burnt wires, mingling with dampness. The room is hidden but vital, keeping the carnival running. On one wall, a switch sparks with blue and white arcs.&#x000A;&#x000A;On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a metal door leads east to Dark Hallway.&#x000A;&#x000A;Currently there are sparks arcing out from the switch.

Too bad you don't have a debit card.&#x000A;&#x000A;To the right, a signboard displays ticket prices alongside illustrations of the rides. Pennant flags flutter and the air is filled with the scent of popcorn, pretzels, and grease.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is worn from the steps of carnival goers eagerly waiting in line as they approach the midway.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. A price list for attraction tickets is on the signboard.

Heady incense wafts through the air, softening everything around the edges. Enhancing the mystique, the backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures. The colorful onion topped buildings and jewel tones set to the sepia colored landscape have you transported far away.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges, draped in flowing silken veils.

Traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna are an accompanying chorus. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands twist in an intricate and mesmerizing pattern. Little Egypt demonstrates remarkable control and fluidity. She dramatically spins, drops, and shimmies, often punctuating the beat with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically.

The booth is lively, with cheering and the clatter of falling bottles. The attendant calls, "Step right up! Three balls for a dime!" Prizes from toys to stuffed animals hang nearby.

A faint sulfuric smell mixes with the scent of popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;The "HELL RIDE" sign pulses above the door, while demon statues with clawed hands seem to beckon. The entrance is shrouded in darkness, broken only by eerie green flashes that reveal twisted paths. Faint whispers and distant organ music grow louder.

Disorganized shelves are lined with tools and parts, while paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches. A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.&#x000A;&#x000A;A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime.

Pipes overhead are wrapped in fraying insulation, crackling as you move. Small puddles of murky water collect.&#x000A;&#x000A;The backstage area continues north and south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[61] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact, housing auxiliary systems for the ride. A soft hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, interrupted only by the occasional hissing of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Circuit breaker panels line the walls, labeled for different functions. Cables and conduits connect the systems to the main hub. Flickering with gauges, a hydraulic pump in the corner manages lifting arms and platforms.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench is cluttered with parts, while shelves above hold spare parts like cables and hydraulic tubing.

You know your place in the world, and your life lessons have served you well. It serves as a gentle reminder that the universe is aligning perfectly in your favor, propelling you forward towards the triumphant realization of your ambitions. The world is at your feet. You're on the right path towards the attainment of your long-cherished aspirations and dreams.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Opportunity: Two of Swords (reversed)&#x000A;Two of Swords reversed suggests that poor choices and hasty decision-making are likely to lead to movement in the wrong direction. It serves as a reminder that impulsive actions can often result in unfavorable outcomes, urging you to carefully consider your options and approach situations with thoughtfulness and patience. By taking the time to weigh your choices and make deliberate decisions, you can avoid the pitfalls that come with rushing into action without considering the potential consequences.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Future: Four of Wands (reversed)&#x000A;Four of Wands reversed indicates the foundation not laid or not ready. Something has caused a disruption in your plans. This could be due to external factors, such as unexpected events that have thrown you off course. Alternatively, it could be self-sabotage, your wavering self-belief or lack of confidence in your abilities can be hindering you from achieving your goals.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the reading concludes, Esmeralda gazes into your eyes with a cryptic smile and delivers their final words of wisdom: "The order of things is important. Alphabetically and numerically; one follows another and provides the link between the two. If you will learn, think on this carefully. Also, don't trust Whidbey. He's up to something."&#x000A;&#x000A;Whether you leave with a sense of wonder or unease, the encounter lingers with you - it's a touch of magic amid the bustling carnival, as if you've glimpsed something beyond the ordinary.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] nw&#x000A;&#x000A;Ticket Booth&#x000A;You can see a janitor and a cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The janitor heads to the Concession Stand.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] nw&#x000A;&#x000A;Bumper Cars&#x000A;The bumper cars are a lively scene of flashing lights and vibrant decorations.

A wooden platform stands at the center, a grim focal point.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure, hands bound and head bowed, stands on the scaffold. Their tattered clothes reveal a once-gilded past.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd jeers while children watch wide-eyed. The town crier proclaims, "High treason against the crown!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned remains silent as the executioner, robed in black, stands beside the guillotine. The blade gleams in the dim light. The crowd's murmurs die, replaced by silence.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches, the guillotine's timing falters. Instead of falling on the scaffold, the blade swings over the cars, threatening any unlucky passenger who passes beneath.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them.

In one corner, tarps and tent poles are stacked.&#x000A;&#x000A;Spare ride seats and an old carousel horse sit under tarps in the center. A cluttered desk holds schedules and coffee cups, with a bulletin board full of flyers.&#x000A;&#x000A;The concrete floor is littered with scraps and dirt. Rats scurry and cobwebs move.

Whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.&#x000A;&#x000A;In a small courtyard, a rusted fence draped with cobwebs and plastic bones encloses the area. A worn sign reads, "You've Survived? For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch quietly, muttering, "Not everyone makes it out."&#x000A;&#x000A;The nearby gift shop glows red.

A wooden platform stands at the center, a grim focal point.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure, hands bound and head bowed, stands on the scaffold. Their tattered clothes reveal a once-gilded past.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd jeers while children watch wide-eyed. The town crier proclaims, "High treason against the crown!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned remains silent as the executioner, robed in black, stands beside the guillotine. The blade gleams in the dim light. The crowd's murmurs die, replaced by silence.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches, the guillotine's timing falters. Instead of falling on the scaffold, the blade swings over the cars, threatening any unlucky passenger who passes beneath.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism.

A worn sign reads, "You've Survived? For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch quietly, muttering, "Not everyone makes it out."&#x000A;&#x000A;The nearby gift shop glows red.

Traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna are an accompanying chorus. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands twist in an intricate and mesmerizing pattern. Little Egypt demonstrates remarkable control and fluidity.

A sparkling, sequined bodice opens into a gauze skirt, adorned with jingling coin belts and jewelry that accentuate her dance.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[47] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing you into the rhythm of the music. Traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna are an accompanying chorus. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands twist in an intricate and mesmerizing pattern. Little Egypt demonstrates remarkable control and fluidity. She dramatically spins, drops, and shimmies, often punctuating the beat with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. In her performance she balances a fine silver sword on her head and accents her dance with tinkling finger cymbals.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The music oscillates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, a roller coaster of emotion that leaves you entranced.

Prizes hang around the booth, from stuffed animals to shiny trinkets. Gleaming plates reflect the light, waiting for dimes. The "ping" of dimes hitting plates is followed by the satisfying "plop" when they land. Shouts of victory and playful groans mix with carnival music and laughter.

The booth is lively, with cheering and the clatter of falling bottles. The attendant calls, "Step right up! Three balls for a dime!" Prizes from toys to stuffed animals hang nearby.

A faint sulfuric smell mixes with the scent of popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;The "HELL RIDE" sign pulses above the door, while demon statues with clawed hands seem to beckon. The entrance is shrouded in darkness, broken only by eerie green flashes that reveal twisted paths. Faint whispers and distant organ music grow louder.

A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.&#x000A;&#x000A;A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime.

Pipes overhead are wrapped in fraying insulation, crackling as you move.

    <command xml:space="preserve">accuse whidbey of insurance fraud</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">Mr Whidbey nervously shifts his weight from one foot to the other.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Ok, I guess you got me. The carnival was losing money and we were going to go out of business. I was desperate to turn things around.&#x000A;&#x000A;Then that Needleman kid got hurt on the bumper cars. We filed an insurance claim for it. When he got paid, Needleman asked if we could get more and split it.&#x000A;&#x000A;It seemed like a good idea at the time. I could get some extra cash to pay the carnival's bills. Then the thought of the money got overwhelming and I thought, "What if there was a fire and the estimate for repairs was, let's shall we say, generous.

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">Mr Whidbey nervously shifts his weight from one foot to the other.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Ok, I guess you got me. The carnival was losing money and we were going to go out of business. I was desperate to turn things around.&#x000A;&#x000A;Then that Needleman kid got hurt on the bumper cars. We filed an insurance claim for it. When he got paid, Needleman asked if we could get more and split it.&#x000A;&#x000A;It seemed like a good idea at the time. I could get some extra cash to pay the carnival's bills.

He seems to be doing something around the guillotine platform. You walk closer to see what he is doing and startle him. Mr Whidbey spins around and glares at you. As he turns and walks out of the room, you think you saw him drop something.&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square hums with tension under gray skies. A wooden platform stands at the center, a grim focal point.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure, hands bound and head bowed, stands on the scaffold. Their tattered clothes reveal a once-gilded past.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd jeers while children watch wide-eyed. The town crier proclaims, "High treason against the crown!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned remains silent as the executioner, robed in black, stands beside the guillotine. The blade gleams in the dim light. The crowd's murmurs die, replaced by silence.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches, the guillotine's timing falters. Instead of falling on the scaffold, the blade swings over the cars, threatening any unlucky passenger who passes beneath.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be seriously injured.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're glad you're not in one of those cars now.
