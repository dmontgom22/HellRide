Its exterior is painted in bright red and yellow stripes, with bold, blocky letters above the window that read "Tickets Here!" Strings of twinkling lights outline the edges, blinking in rhythmic patterns to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk is compact, with a single window where a smiling attendant greets visitors. Behind the glass, rows of ticket rolls in vibrant colors - blue, red, and yellow - are neatly arranged in dispensers. A small cash drawer sits open beside them, jingling softly as the attendant counts out change. To the side of the window, a digital payment system is set up for those who prefer modern convenience, its screen glowing faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;A colorful signboard is propped up next to the kiosk, listing ticket prices for rides, games, and attractions. At the top, in bold letters, it reads: "Step Right Up! Your Adventure Awaits!" Below, the list of options is accompanied by playful illustrations of roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and cotton candy.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk roof juts out slightly, providing shelter to visitors during rain or shine. Bright pennant flags are strung from the corners of the roof to nearby poles, fluttering in the breeze and adding to the festive atmosphere. The smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts through the air, carried over from nearby food stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground around the kiosk is well-trodden, with patches of worn grass and compacted dirt revealing the heavy foot traffic of eager carnival-goers. A line of families, couples, and groups of friends forms in front of the kiosk, buzzing with excitement as they wait their turn to purchase tickets.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ticket kiosk is more than just a point of entry-it's the first step into the carnival's magic, where anticipation builds and the promise of thrills and wonders begins to take shape.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues east and west from here.

The booth is painted in cheerful, primary colors-reds, blues, and yellows-with bold lettering across the top that proclaims: "SODA! POPCORN! CANDY APPLES! COTTON CANDY! PRETZELS!" Strings of tiny, twinkling lights frame the stand, casting a warm glow that makes it stand out even in the carnival's dazzling atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the counter, the scene is a whirlwind of movement. A large popcorn machine sits to one side, its glass case fogged up with heat as golden kernels tumble and pop inside, filling the air with their buttery aroma. Nearby, a spinning rack of candy apples gleams under the lights, their glossy red coatings catching every glimmer. Cotton candy machines whirl on the opposite side, their sugary strands forming fluffy clouds of pink and blue, ready to be twirled onto paper cones.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacks of soft pretzels sit under a heat lamp, their golden-brown surfaces glistening with melted butter and coarse salt. Warm, doughy scents mingle with the sugary sweetness of the candy apples and cotton candy, creating an irresistible combination. Ice-cold sodas are arranged in a cooler behind the counter, their colorful labels visible through the condensation on the glass door.&#x000A;&#x000A;The counter top is a cheerful chaos of activity. Paper bags and napkins are stacked neatly in one corner, alongside small cups of nacho cheese for pretzels and sugar sprinkles for cotton candy. A handwritten menu board leans against the front of the stand, listing prices in playful chalk lettering.&#x000A;&#x000A;The workers, wearing brightly colored aprons and matching hats, move quickly and efficiently, handing out snacks to eager customers. Behind them, shelves are stocked with supplies: bags of popcorn kernels, bottles of soda syrup, and tubs of pretzel dough, ready to keep the stand running all night.&#x000A;&#x000A;In front of the stand, the crowd is lively and animated. Children tug at their parents" sleeves, pointing at the spinning cotton candy or the shiny candy apples. Teens laugh and chat as they sip sodas and share buttery pretzels.

As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now-one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction facade is to the east. There is a folding chair should you want to sit down and wait for the show to start.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you enter the dimly lit tent, you see that the stage is decorated to resemble an exotic Middle Eastern market or palace, featuring rich, colorful fabrics, brass ornaments, and lanterns casting a warm, flickering glow. Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance. Her attire consists of a sparkling, sequined bodice and a flowing skirt, adorned with jingling coin belts and jewelry that accentuate her movements.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] n&#x000A;You're much too entranced to do anything other than watch the show. You are riveted!&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing the you into the rhythm of exotic live music played on traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. During her performance she balances a sword on her head and accents her dance with finger cymbals.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The music alternates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, creating an emotional arc that keeps the you entranced. Little Egypt relies on the music's dynamic changes to tell a story with movements reflecting joy, sorrow, seduction, and celebration.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance concludes with a dramatic flourish of a fast-paced shimmy, a bold spin, and Little Egypt dramatically casts off her veils. The dancer takes a bow to enthusiastic applause, leaving you spellbound by the sensual yet artful display.&#x000A;&#x000A;You applaud until your hands are sore. Did she just wink at me?&#x000A;&#x000A;As she leaves the stage, Little Egypt tosses one of her veils to you!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Facade&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Kiosk&#x000A;You can see a Cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Parking Lot&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] i&#x000A;You are carrying:&#x000A;  a sheer veil&#x000A;  blueberries&#x000A;  a wallet&#x000A;    $15.00 in cash&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] score&#x000A;You have so far scored 10 out of a possible 100, in 18 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] test concession&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] brief&#x000A;Hell Ride is now in its "brief" printing mode, which gives long descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] get blueberries&#x000A;You already have that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[25] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Kiosk&#x000A;You can see a Cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Concession Stand&#x000A;The concession stand is a vibrant, bustling hub of activity, perched along the midway with its enticing smells and bright signage luring carnival-goers. The booth is painted in cheerful, primary colors-reds, blues, and yellows-with bold lettering across the top that proclaims: "SODA! POPCORN! CANDY APPLES! COTTON CANDY! PRETZELS!" Strings of tiny, twinkling lights frame the stand, casting a warm glow that makes it stand out even in the carnival's dazzling atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the counter, the scene is a whirlwind of movement. A large popcorn machine sits to one side, its glass case fogged up with heat as golden kernels tumble and pop inside, filling the air with their buttery aroma. Nearby, a spinning rack of candy apples gleams under the lights, their glossy red coatings catching every glimmer. Cotton candy machines whirl on the opposite side, their sugary strands forming fluffy clouds of pink and blue, ready to be twirled onto paper cones.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacks of soft pretzels sit under a heat lamp, their golden-brown surfaces glistening with melted butter and coarse salt. Warm, doughy scents mingle with the sugary sweetness of the candy apples and cotton candy, creating an irresistible combination. Ice-cold sodas are arranged in a cooler behind the counter, their colorful labels visible through the condensation on the glass door.&#x000A;&#x000A;The counter top is a cheerful chaos of activity. Paper bags and napkins are stacked neatly in one corner, alongside small cups of nacho cheese for pretzels and sugar sprinkles for cotton candy. A handwritten menu board leans against the front of the stand, listing prices in playful chalk lettering.&#x000A;&#x000A;The workers, wearing brightly colored aprons and matching hats, move quickly and efficiently, handing out snacks to eager customers. Behind them, shelves are stocked with supplies: bags of popcorn kernels, bottles of soda syrup, and tubs of pretzel dough, ready to keep the stand running all night.&#x000A;&#x000A;In front of the stand, the crowd is lively and animated. Children tug at their parents" sleeves, pointing at the spinning cotton candy or the shiny candy apples. Teens laugh and chat as they sip sodas and share buttery pretzels.

At the center is a sturdy metal pole, with a large bell hanging at the top, signaling when a successful attempt has been made. Along the length of the pole are markings indicating how strong you are.  A nearby sign says, "Buy a mallet, strike the bell, win a prize."&#x000A;&#x000A;Spectators gather around, cheering on participants and offering lighthearted jabs and encouragement, creating a lively, competitive atmosphere.

To the south is the track that will take you into the ride. The safety bar is raised allowing you to enter the car.

The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[80] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[81] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[82] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[85] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 15 out of a possible 100, in 69 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Its exterior is painted in bright red and yellow stripes, with bold, blocky letters above the window that read "Tickets Here!" Strings of twinkling lights outline the edges, blinking in rhythmic patterns to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk is compact, with a single window where a smiling attendant greets visitors. Behind the glass, rows of ticket rolls in vibrant colors - blue, red, and yellow - are neatly arranged in dispensers. A small cash drawer sits open beside them, jingling softly as the attendant counts out change. To the side of the window, a digital payment system is set up for those who prefer modern convenience, its screen glowing faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;A colorful signboard is propped up next to the kiosk, listing ticket prices for rides, games, and attractions. At the top, in bold letters, it reads: "Step Right Up! Your Adventure Awaits!" Below, the list of options is accompanied by playful illustrations of roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and cotton candy.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk roof juts out slightly, providing shelter to visitors during rain or shine. Bright pennant flags are strung from the corners of the roof to nearby poles, fluttering in the breeze and adding to the festive atmosphere. The smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts through the air, carried over from nearby food stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground around the kiosk is well-trodden, with patches of worn grass and compacted dirt revealing the heavy foot traffic of eager carnival-goers. A line of families, couples, and groups of friends forms in front of the kiosk, buzzing with excitement as they wait their turn to purchase tickets.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ticket kiosk is more than just a point of entry-it's the first step into the carnival's magic, where anticipation builds and the promise of thrills and wonders begins to take shape.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues east and west from here.

A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Exotic!" A rotund attendant, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him that says "Dime Admission."&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers. Perhaps there's a fortune teller inside, offering cryptic clues about the player's journey or a hidden artifact that can be collected. There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up, pay for, and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.The barker cries:&#x000A;&#x000A;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather "round! &#x000A;Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! &#x000A;She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. &#x000A;Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids-a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and exotic allure! &#x000A;For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] l at barker&#x000A;Here is a man dressed in black pants, a white shirt,a striped vest, a fez, and a dazzling smile.

As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now-one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction facade is to the east. There is a folding chair should you want to sit down and wait for the show to start.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you enter the dimly lit tent, you see that the stage is decorated to resemble an exotic Middle Eastern market or palace, featuring rich, colorful fabrics, brass ornaments, and lanterns casting a warm, flickering glow. Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance.

You are riveted!&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing the you into the rhythm of exotic live music played on traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically.

The booth is painted in cheerful, primary colors-reds, blues, and yellows-with bold lettering across the top that proclaims: "SODA! POPCORN! CANDY APPLES! COTTON CANDY! PRETZELS!" Strings of tiny, twinkling lights frame the stand, casting a warm glow that makes it stand out even in the carnival's dazzling atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the counter, the scene is a whirlwind of movement. A large popcorn machine sits to one side, its glass case fogged up with heat as golden kernels tumble and pop inside, filling the air with their buttery aroma. Nearby, a spinning rack of candy apples gleams under the lights, their glossy red coatings catching every glimmer. Cotton candy machines whirl on the opposite side, their sugary strands forming fluffy clouds of pink and blue, ready to be twirled onto paper cones.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacks of soft pretzels sit under a heat lamp, their golden-brown surfaces glistening with melted butter and coarse salt. Warm, doughy scents mingle with the sugary sweetness of the candy apples and cotton candy, creating an irresistible combination. Ice-cold sodas are arranged in a cooler behind the counter, their colorful labels visible through the condensation on the glass door.&#x000A;&#x000A;The counter top is a cheerful chaos of activity. Paper bags and napkins are stacked neatly in one corner, alongside small cups of nacho cheese for pretzels and sugar sprinkles for cotton candy. A handwritten menu board leans against the front of the stand, listing prices in playful chalk lettering.&#x000A;&#x000A;The workers, wearing brightly colored aprons and matching hats, move quickly and efficiently, handing out snacks to eager customers. Behind them, shelves are stocked with supplies: bags of popcorn kernels, bottles of soda syrup, and tubs of pretzel dough, ready to keep the stand running all night.&#x000A;&#x000A;In front of the stand, the crowd is lively and animated. Children tug at their parents" sleeves, pointing at the spinning cotton candy or the shiny candy apples. Teens laugh and chat as they sip sodas and share buttery pretzels. The stand is not just a place to grab a quick snack-it's a sensory experience that enhances the carnival's magic, offering a delicious pause amid the excitement.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a menu to the right of the window.

Here's a prize for you."&#x000A;Which prize would you like? 1) a teddy bear, 2) a Swiss Army knife, 3) a poster of Taylor Swift, or 4) a magenta fuse?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] 2&#x000A;You are now holding a Swiss Army knife.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[57] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Kiosk&#x000A;You can see a Cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[58] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Parking Lot&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[59] i&#x000A;You are carrying:&#x000A;  a Swiss army knife&#x000A;    a screwdriver&#x000A;    awl&#x000A;    fingernail clippers&#x000A;    can opener&#x000A;    corkscrew&#x000A;  a mallet&#x000A;  a soft pretzel&#x000A;  cotton candy&#x000A;  a candy apple&#x000A;  a bucket of popcorn&#x000A;  an empty can&#x000A;  a sheer veil&#x000A;  blueberries&#x000A;  a wallet&#x000A;    $5.00 in cash&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[60] score&#x000A;You have so far scored 15 out of a possible 100, in 50 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[61] test misc&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[62] brief&#x000A;Hell Ride is now in its "brief" printing mode, which gives long descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[63] get blueberries&#x000A;You already have that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[64] xyzzy&#x000A;A voice nearby says "Plugh".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[65] hello sailor&#x000A;Nothing happens here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[66] please get the dime&#x000A;Please do not say please.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[67] i&#x000A;You are carrying:&#x000A;  a Swiss army knife&#x000A;    a screwdriver&#x000A;    awl&#x000A;    fingernail clippers&#x000A;    can opener&#x000A;    corkscrew&#x000A;  a mallet&#x000A;  a soft pretzel&#x000A;  cotton candy&#x000A;  a candy apple&#x000A;  a bucket of popcorn&#x000A;  an empty can&#x000A;  a sheer veil&#x000A;  blueberries&#x000A;  a wallet&#x000A;    $5.00 in cash&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[68] score&#x000A;You have so far scored 15 out of a possible 100, in 54 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[69] test ride&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[70] brief&#x000A;Hell Ride is now in its "brief" printing mode, which gives long descriptions of places never before visited and short descriptions otherwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] get blueberries&#x000A;You already have that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[72] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Kiosk&#x000A;You can see a Cashier here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[73] buy hell ride ticket&#x000A;You fork over $2.50 for the Hell Ride ticket, leaving yourself with $2.50.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[74] s&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Head of the Line&#x000A;You are standing in front of a ticket taker with his hand open waiting for your ticket.

To the south is the track that will take you into the ride. The safety bar is raised allowing you to enter the car. The darkness looks just a little bit darker.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[77] enter car&#x000A;You get into the car.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[78] wait&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The car moves forward and the safety bar begins to lower.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[79] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Entrance&#x000A;The car has begun to move toward the entrance of the ride and the safety bar has been lowered. The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[80] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[81] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[82] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[85] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 15 out of a possible 100, in 69 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>

Its exterior is painted in bright red and yellow stripes, with bold, blocky letters above the window that read "Tickets Here!" Strings of twinkling lights outline the edges, blinking in rhythmic patterns to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk is compact, with a single window where a smiling attendant greets visitors. Behind the glass, rows of ticket rolls in vibrant colors - blue, red, and yellow - are neatly arranged in dispensers. A small cash drawer sits open beside them, jingling softly as the attendant counts out change. To the side of the window, a digital payment system is set up for those who prefer modern convenience, its screen glowing faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;A colorful signboard is propped up next to the kiosk, listing ticket prices for rides, games, and attractions. At the top, in bold letters, it reads: "Step Right Up! Your Adventure Awaits!" Below, the list of options is accompanied by playful illustrations of roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and cotton candy.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk roof juts out slightly, providing shelter to visitors during rain or shine. Bright pennant flags are strung from the corners of the roof to nearby poles, fluttering in the breeze and adding to the festive atmosphere. The smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts through the air, carried over from nearby food stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground around the kiosk is well-trodden, with patches of worn grass and compacted dirt revealing the heavy foot traffic of eager carnival-goers. A line of families, couples, and groups of friends forms in front of the kiosk, buzzing with excitement as they wait their turn to purchase tickets.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ticket kiosk is more than just a point of entry-it's the first step into the carnival's magic, where anticipation builds and the promise of thrills and wonders begins to take shape.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues east and west from here.

A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Exotic!" A rotund attendant, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him that says "Dime Admission."&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers. Perhaps there's a fortune teller inside, offering cryptic clues about the player's journey or a hidden artifact that can be collected. There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up, pay for, and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.The barker cries:&#x000A;&#x000A;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather "round! &#x000A;Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! &#x000A;She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. &#x000A;Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids-a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and exotic allure! &#x000A;For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] l at barker&#x000A;Here is a man dressed in black pants, a white shirt,a striped vest, a fez, and a dazzling smile.

As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now-one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction facade is to the east. There is a folding chair should you want to sit down and wait for the show to start.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you enter the dimly lit tent, you see that the stage is decorated to resemble an exotic Middle Eastern market or palace, featuring rich, colorful fabrics, brass ornaments, and lanterns casting a warm, flickering glow. Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance. Her attire consists of a sparkling, sequined bodice and a flowing skirt, adorned with jingling coin belts and jewelry that accentuate her movements.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] n&#x000A;You're much too entranced to do anything other than watch the show. You are riveted!&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing the you into the rhythm of exotic live music played on traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. During her performance she balances a sword on her head and accents her dance with finger cymbals.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The music alternates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, creating an emotional arc that keeps the you entranced.

A strong, narrow beam of light shines from the flashlight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[81] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The maintenance office is a chaotic and dimly lit space tucked away behind the glitz and glamour of the carnival. It smells of grease, sweat, and faintly of popcorn from the midway outside. The air is heavy and warm, thick with the lingering scent of oil and dust stirred up by constant work.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with cluttered shelves holding an assortment of tools and parts-rusty wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, bolts, and screws organized (or not) in mismatched containers. Tattered labels, some scrawled in fading marker, hint at what lies inside. Cans of paint, grease, and lubricant sit precariously on the edges of workbenches, their lids half-open or missing entirely.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by a large desk scarred with years of use. A vise clamp holds a bent piece of metal in place, while a spread of loose wires, gears, and springs litter the surface. A single, broken fluorescent light hangs from the ceiling.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism sits, its inner workings exposed like the guts of a machine. Chains and pulleys dangle from hooks overhead, their metallic clink echoing faintly as they sway slightly with the vibration of the rides outside. A half-drained mug of coffee sits forgotten on a stool nearby, next to a grease-stained manual lying open to a random page.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls bear evidence of the room's purpose: faded safety posters warning of hazards, a cork board pinned with ride maintenance schedules and hastily scribbled notes, and a faded photograph of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly in the background, though its hands don't seem to match the current time.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is uneven and gritty, coated in a fine layer of dust and littered with stray nails and scraps of metal. In one corner, a toolbox sits half-open, its contents spilling out as though abandoned mid-task. Nearby, a rickety fan struggles to spin, offering little relief from the oppressive heat.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the disarray, the room hums with purpose. This is the beating heart of the carnival's machinery, a hidden realm where the magic of the attractions is kept alive by grease-stained hands and sheer determination.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio is off.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a ladder, an aqua door, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[82] turn on radio&#x000A;You flip a switch. Through the static, you pick up hear bits of the latest Taylor Swift song.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] l at desk&#x000A;It's a desk. There are coffee stains and cigarette burns from years of abuse. The single drawer is shut.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The DJ just cued up Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] open drawer&#x000A;You open the drawer, revealing a scissors, a stapler, a ballpoint pen, and a pad of paper.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[85] get all from the drawer&#x000A;scissors: Taken.&#x000A;stapler: Taken.&#x000A;ballpoint pen: Taken.&#x000A;pad of paper: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash is on the air."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[86] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;The crawl space beneath the carnival ride is a tight, claustrophobic tunnel shrouded in darkness and filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[87] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is smaller and more focused, housing the auxiliary systems that support the ride's operation. It's quieter than the south room, though the hum of capacitors and relays creates a constant, low background noise. Rows of electrical panels line the walls, each labeled with functions such as "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems", and "Emergency Shutdown". Smaller cables and conduits run along the walls, connecting these systems to the main hub in the south room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir control specific mechanisms of the ride, such as lifting arms or rotating platforms. Pressure gauges flicker intermittently, and the occasional hiss of fluid escaping creates a sharp contrast to the otherwise subdued atmosphere. A small generator sits nearby, its housing slightly dented but functional, ready to activate in case of a power failure.&#x000A;&#x000A;A compact workbench is tucked against the eastern wall, strewn with tools and coiled wires. Above it, shelves are stacked with neatly labeled replacement parts: fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded diagram of the ride's layout is pinned to the wall nearby, marked with annotations in red ink from previous maintenance efforts.&#x000A;&#x000A;The lighting is dimmer here, provided by a single hanging bulb that casts soft shadows across the room. The air feels cooler and slightly damp, with a faint smell of mildew mixing with the metallic tang of the machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;The north mechanical room functions as a support system, ensuring that auxiliary processes run smoothly and that emergency backups are ready to deploy if needed. Though quieter and less imposing than its southern counterpart, it is just as critical to the ride's overall operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[88] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel locks, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[89] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel locks: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[90] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the heart of the carnival ride, a large, noisy space where the primary systems are housed. The room is dominated by a massive motor, its rhythmic hum filling the air as it drives the ride's main mechanics. Thick belts and pulleys extend from the motor to a series of gears and drive shafts, each component working in seamless coordination to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with heavy-duty electrical panels, their surfaces marked with warning labels like "High Voltage" and "Do Not Open While Powered". Bright indicator lights blink in greens and reds, providing a visual heartbeat to the room's constant activity. Overhead, insulated wires and steel conduits run along the ceiling, their routes clearly labeled but seemingly endless.&#x000A;&#x000A;A workbench along one wall is cluttered with tools-wrenches, screwdrivers, and pliers-neatly arranged next to containers of spare parts like bolts, washers, and lubricants. Manuals and maintenance logs sit open, their pages marked with grease-stained fingerprints. The faint smell of oil and metal pervades the air, along with a hint of ozone from the electrical systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan whirs in the corner, its blades spinning in a futile attempt to temper the room's warmth. The sound of chains clinking occasionally breaks through the hum, accompanied by the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid releasing pressure. The floor is a patchwork of metal grates and concrete, worn smooth in some areas by years of use.&#x000A;&#x000A;The south mechanical room is brightly lit, with overhead fluorescent lights encased in protective wire cages. This is the main operations hub, where the power of the ride is generated and controlled, ensuring its thrilling movements stay in sync.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[91] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;The generator room is a compact, industrial space tucked away from the vibrant chaos of the carnival, where the hum and flicker of electricity are birthed to power the attractions. The walls are constructed of reinforced concrete, their surfaces marked with grime, oil streaks, and the faint outlines of graffiti left by past workers. The room smells of diesel fuel, hot metal, and the faint tang of ozone, mingled with the earthy scent of dampness from the surrounding ground.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center of the room sits the main generator, a hulking, metallic beast of machinery. Its steel casing is scuffed and dented from years of use, though it still functions with a steady, low rumble that resonates through the floor. Thick cables, black and rubberized, extend like veins from the generator to the room's walls, where they feed into an array of junction boxes and circuit breakers.&#x000A;&#x000A;The generator's control panel is mounted to one side, cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges. Labels, many peeling or faded, identify each component: "Fuel Intake", "Voltage Control", "Emergency Shutoff". A small display screen flickers with real-time readouts, showing power levels and load distribution to the various carnival attractions.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is made of rough, uneven concrete, with small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation pooling in its crevices. Along the walls, shelves are stacked with spare parts-fuel filters, spark plugs, and coils of insulated wire. Tools are scattered on a nearby workbench, alongside a canister of grease and a well-worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is thick and warm, vibrating faintly with the generator's operation. A vent in the corner struggles to extract the heat, its fan spinning with a faint, rhythmic whir. The dim lighting in the room comes from a single industrial bulb encased in a protective cage, casting harsh shadows across the machinery and walls.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a row of diesel fuel canisters stands neatly arranged, their metallic surfaces gleaming under the light. A faded safety poster hangs above them, its message barely legible: "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its utilitarian design, the room carries an air of importance. The generator room is the heartbeat of the carnival, its steady output ensuring that the lights flash, the rides whirl, and the sounds of joy and terror continue uninterrupted. Yet, in its stark isolation, it feels oddly disconnected from the lively world it powers, a quiet reminder of the machinery behind the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[92] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a compact but vital space, tucked away behind the scenes of the carnival's bustling attractions. The room hums with a steady, electric energy, the air thick with the scent of overheated wires, metal, and a faint tang of ozone. The walls are lined with metal panels, some polished and sleek, others weathered and streaked with grease from years of operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel dominates one wall, its surface covered in a grid of switches and levers, each labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights", "Carousel Motors", and "Midway Games". Bright indicator lights blink sporadically, casting green, yellow, and red glows that reflect off the polished steel surfaces. Overhead, conduits and thick bundles of cables snake across the ceiling, bound together with zip ties and disappearing into the walls to distribute power throughout the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner of the room, a junction box sits open, its wires spilling out like the veins of the carnival. A maintenance worker's touch lingers here, with tools scattered on a small workbench nearby: wire cutters, screwdrivers, and spools of electrical tape. A laminated wiring diagram is pinned to the wall above the bench, its corners dog-eared and smudged with greasy fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is dirt, its surface marked with scratches, oil stains, and scattered bits of wire clippings. A faint vibration runs through the room, a pulse from the generator in the adjacent space or the distant hum of the carnival rides.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mounted along another wall is an emergency shutdown panel, painted bright red with a prominent lever labeled "Master Power Off." A fire extinguisher hangs nearby, accompanied by a faded safety poster warning about the dangers of electrical fires. Below it, a collection of replacement fuses and circuit boards are neatly arranged on a shelf, ready for use when something inevitably malfunctions.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small fan sits on the workbench, oscillating weakly to counter the oppressive heat radiating from the machinery. The light in the room comes from bare fluorescent tubes overhead, their cold glow flickering slightly, casting sharp shadows that shift with every movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its functionality, the electrical room carries a certain unease. The constant hum of electricity, the flicker of lights, and the sharpness of exposed wires hint at the delicate balance of power keeping the carnival alive. It's a space where the magic of the midway is stripped bare, revealing the raw energy coursing through its veins.&#x000A;&#x000A;This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous! There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[93] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;You are in a section of the electrical room. There is an electrical panel here.

The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door and a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[106] l under stocks&#x000A;You find the aqua fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[107] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door, a ladder, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[108] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[109] w&#x000A;(first opening the crimson door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the crimson door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near.

The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[110] l under platform&#x000A;You find the crimson fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[111] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[112] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[113] w&#x000A;(first opening the emerald door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the emerald door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[114] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is an emerald fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[115] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[116] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[117] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[118] w&#x000A;(first opening the gray door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the gray door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[119] l under seat&#x000A;You find the gray fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[120] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[121] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[122] w&#x000A;(first opening the indigo door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the indigo door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"This man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door and a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[123] l under platform&#x000A;You find the indigo fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[124] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[125] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[126] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a chaotic yet oddly functional space, tucked away from the flashing lights and lively crowds. Its walls are made of corrugated metal or weathered wood, with patches of rust and peeling paint revealing the room's age. The faint smell of grease, dust, and damp canvas hangs in the air, mingled with a hint of stale popcorn and cotton candy from the midway outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves line the walls, crammed with a mishmash of supplies. Boxes of lightbulbs, spools of electrical wiring, and stacks of replacement parts for rides and games are piled haphazardly, some labeled in fading marker, others left to mystery. A collection of brightly colored pennant flags and strings of carnival lights dangles from hooks, their wires tangled into an unruly knot.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a pile of folded canvas tarps and tent poles leans precariously against the wall, ready to be deployed for setting up new attractions or repairing existing ones. Nearby, over sized crates are labeled with blocky stencils: "GAME PRIZES", RIDE PARTS", and "SPARE SIGNAGE". One crate is open, revealing a jumble of stuffed animals, rubber balls, and plastic toys meant to delight lucky winners.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by larger items-spare seats for rides, unassembled game booths, and the occasional disassembled attraction part, like a faded carousel horse or a section of a Ferris wheel's gondola. These are covered in tarps or wrapped in protective blankets, their surfaces scratched and worn from transport and use.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small, battered desk sits near the entrance, cluttered with maintenance logs, mismatched tools, and a few empty coffee cups. Above it, a cork board displays a chaotic array of pinned notes: ride schedules, repair requests, and a map of the carnival grounds with certain areas circled in red. A single fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting uneven shadows across the room and giving it a slightly eerie feel.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of concrete and dirt, strewn with stray bolts, screws, and scraps of paper. In the darker corners, the scuttling of a rat or the glint of a spider's web serves as a reminder that this space, while essential, is far from pristine.&#x000A;&#x000A;The carnival storage room is not glamorous, but it is vital-a hidden world of spare parts, forgotten treasures, and organized chaos that keeps the carnival running smoothly. It's a backstage glimpse into the hard work and improvisation that make the magic possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[127] w&#x000A;(first opening the khaki door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the khaki door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is as unsettling as the ride itself, designed to leave riders with a lingering sense of unease. The pathway emerges from a dark, narrow corridor, its walls painted in peeling black with streaks of red that resemble dripping blood. Dim, flickering lights cast erratic shadows across the uneven floor, creating an oppressive atmosphere that follows riders even after they've left the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is cooler here, with a faint metallic tang and the unmistakable scent of dampness, as though the exit leads not back to the carnival but somewhere deeper underground. Sound effects of faint whispers and distant screams play softly in the background, barely audible over the creak of the exit door swinging open and the occasional burst of laughter or screams from the ride's next passengers.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step out into a small courtyard, enclosed by jagged, rusted metal fencing adorned with fake cobwebs and plastic bones. A weathered sign swings overhead, painted in bold, Gothic letters: "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now."&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a few carnival workers in tattered costumes linger, their expressions disturbingly neutral as they watch riders leave. One might mumble cryptic phrases like, "Not everyone makes it out&#x2026;" before breaking into a crooked grin.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit path leads past a small merchandise stand selling ride-themed merchandise-"Hell Ride Survivor" t-shirts, devil horns, and glow-in-the-dark trinkets shaped like skulls. The stand is bathed in red light, adding to the ominous mood.&#x000A;&#x000A;Just beyond the fencing, the cheerful sounds and colorful lights of the carnival midway feel jarringly out of place, a sharp contrast to the oppressive darkness of the ride. Riders often pause to gather themselves, exchanging nervous laughter or adjusting their belongings, before stepping back into the lively world of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Hell Ride exit leaves riders not just thrilled, but marked by the eerie experience, a reminder of the fine line between fun and fear that defines the carnival's darkest attraction.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[128] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand is a khaki fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[129] get khaki fuse from merchandise stand&#x000A;You find nothing!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[130] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[131] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[132] test b3&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[133] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[134] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[135] put aqua in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[136] push switch&#x000A;The indicator light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[137] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[138] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;You are in a section of the electrical room.

It's where the real work happens-a nerve center for monitoring and managing the operations of the rides, attractions, and lighting systems. The room is enclosed by plain, industrial walls, painted a dull gray and marked with scuffs, scratches, and the occasional smudge of grease or fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rows of monitors line the main wall, displaying live feeds from security cameras and ride controls. Each screen shows a different part of the carnival: blinking lights of the Ferris wheel, the whirling motion of a carousel, and the eerie darkness of the Hell Ride. A few screens flicker or show static, adding to the sense of wear and tear that pervades the room. Beneath the monitors, a control panel is cluttered with switches, buttons, and dials, each labeled with functions like "Ride Start," "Lighting Override", and "Emergency Stop." Small lights blink in green, yellow, or red, signaling the status of different systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics fills the air, mingled with the occasional crackle of a two-way radio resting on a desk. The radios buzz intermittently with the voices of carnival workers reporting issues or coordinating movements: "Maintenance to Tilt-a-Whirl-need a wrench at Station 2!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of worn linoleum and exposed concrete, littered with stray papers, toolkits, and empty coffee cups. A cluttered desk sits against one wall, covered with logbooks, ride schedules, and laminated emergency procedures. A corkboard above the desk is pinned with maintenance charts, carnival maps, and handwritten notes, some of them circled in red ink with messages like "Check circuit breakers on Zipper" or "Replace bulbs near south entrance."&#x000A;&#x000A;A single fluorescent light fixture hangs overhead, buzzing faintly as it casts a cold, sterile glow across the room. The air is cool but tinged with a faint metallic smell, mixed with the earthy dampness from the surrounding carnival grounds. In one corner, a small, battered first-aid kit hangs on the wall, its contents slightly spilling out, and a faded fire extinguisher sits nearby.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its unassuming appearance, the control room feels alive with purpose-a behind-the-scenes hub that ensures the carnival's magic unfolds without a hitch.

Its exterior is painted in bright red and yellow stripes, with bold, blocky letters above the window that read "Tickets Here!" Strings of twinkling lights outline the edges, blinking in rhythmic patterns to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk is compact, with a single window where a smiling attendant greets visitors. Behind the glass, rows of ticket rolls in vibrant colors - blue, red, and yellow - are neatly arranged in dispensers. A small cash drawer sits open beside them, jingling softly as the attendant counts out change. To the side of the window, a digital payment system is set up for those who prefer modern convenience, its screen glowing faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;A colorful signboard is propped up next to the kiosk, listing ticket prices for rides, games, and attractions. At the top, in bold letters, it reads: "Step Right Up! Your Adventure Awaits!" Below, the list of options is accompanied by playful illustrations of roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and cotton candy.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk roof juts out slightly, providing shelter to visitors during rain or shine. Bright pennant flags are strung from the corners of the roof to nearby poles, fluttering in the breeze and adding to the festive atmosphere. The smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts through the air, carried over from nearby food stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground around the kiosk is well-trodden, with patches of worn grass and compacted dirt revealing the heavy foot traffic of eager carnival-goers. A line of families, couples, and groups of friends forms in front of the kiosk, buzzing with excitement as they wait their turn to purchase tickets.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ticket kiosk is more than just a point of entry-it's the first step into the carnival's magic, where anticipation builds and the promise of thrills and wonders begins to take shape.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues east and west from here.

As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now-one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction facade is to the east.

As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically.

Strings of tiny, twinkling lights frame the stand, casting a warm glow that makes it stand out even in the carnival's dazzling atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the counter, the scene is a whirlwind of movement. A large popcorn machine sits to one side, its glass case fogged up with heat as golden kernels tumble and pop inside, filling the air with their buttery aroma. Nearby, a spinning rack of candy apples gleams under the lights, their glossy red coatings catching every glimmer. Cotton candy machines whirl on the opposite side, their sugary strands forming fluffy clouds of pink and blue, ready to be twirled onto paper cones.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacks of soft pretzels sit under a heat lamp, their golden-brown surfaces glistening with melted butter and coarse salt. Warm, doughy scents mingle with the sugary sweetness of the candy apples and cotton candy, creating an irresistible combination. Ice-cold sodas are arranged in a cooler behind the counter, their colorful labels visible through the condensation on the glass door.&#x000A;&#x000A;The counter top is a cheerful chaos of activity. Paper bags and napkins are stacked neatly in one corner, alongside small cups of nacho cheese for pretzels and sugar sprinkles for cotton candy. A handwritten menu board leans against the front of the stand, listing prices in playful chalk lettering.&#x000A;&#x000A;The workers, wearing brightly colored aprons and matching hats, move quickly and efficiently, handing out snacks to eager customers. Behind them, shelves are stocked with supplies: bags of popcorn kernels, bottles of soda syrup, and tubs of pretzel dough, ready to keep the stand running all night.&#x000A;&#x000A;In front of the stand, the crowd is lively and animated. Children tug at their parents" sleeves, pointing at the spinning cotton candy or the shiny candy apples. Teens laugh and chat as they sip sodas and share buttery pretzels.

A strong, narrow beam of light shines from the flashlight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[81] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The maintenance office is a chaotic and dimly lit space tucked away behind the glitz and glamour of the carnival. It smells of grease, sweat, and faintly of popcorn from the midway outside. The air is heavy and warm, thick with the lingering scent of oil and dust stirred up by constant work.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with cluttered shelves holding an assortment of tools and parts-rusty wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, bolts, and screws organized (or not) in mismatched containers. Tattered labels, some scrawled in fading marker, hint at what lies inside. Cans of paint, grease, and lubricant sit precariously on the edges of workbenches, their lids half-open or missing entirely.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by a large desk scarred with years of use. A vise clamp holds a bent piece of metal in place, while a spread of loose wires, gears, and springs litter the surface. A single, broken fluorescent light hangs from the ceiling.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism sits, its inner workings exposed like the guts of a machine. Chains and pulleys dangle from hooks overhead, their metallic clink echoing faintly as they sway slightly with the vibration of the rides outside. A half-drained mug of coffee sits forgotten on a stool nearby, next to a grease-stained manual lying open to a random page.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls bear evidence of the room's purpose: faded safety posters warning of hazards, a cork board pinned with ride maintenance schedules and hastily scribbled notes, and a faded photograph of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly in the background, though its hands don't seem to match the current time.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is uneven and gritty, coated in a fine layer of dust and littered with stray nails and scraps of metal. In one corner, a toolbox sits half-open, its contents spilling out as though abandoned mid-task. Nearby, a rickety fan struggles to spin, offering little relief from the oppressive heat.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the disarray, the room hums with purpose. This is the beating heart of the carnival's machinery, a hidden realm where the magic of the attractions is kept alive by grease-stained hands and sheer determination.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio is off.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a ladder, an aqua door, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[82] turn on radio&#x000A;You flip a switch. Through the static, you pick up hear bits of the latest Taylor Swift song.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] l at desk&#x000A;It's a desk. There are coffee stains and cigarette burns from years of abuse. The single drawer is shut.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The DJ just cued up Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] open drawer&#x000A;You open the drawer, revealing a scissors, a stapler, a ballpoint pen, and a pad of paper.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[85] get all from the drawer&#x000A;scissors: Taken.&#x000A;stapler: Taken.&#x000A;ballpoint pen: Taken.&#x000A;pad of paper: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash is on the air."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[86] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;The crawl space beneath the carnival ride is a tight, claustrophobic tunnel shrouded in darkness and filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[87] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is smaller and more focused, housing the auxiliary systems that support the ride's operation. It's quieter than the south room, though the hum of capacitors and relays creates a constant, low background noise. Rows of electrical panels line the walls, each labeled with functions such as "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems", and "Emergency Shutdown". Smaller cables and conduits run along the walls, connecting these systems to the main hub in the south room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir control specific mechanisms of the ride, such as lifting arms or rotating platforms. Pressure gauges flicker intermittently, and the occasional hiss of fluid escaping creates a sharp contrast to the otherwise subdued atmosphere. A small generator sits nearby, its housing slightly dented but functional, ready to activate in case of a power failure.&#x000A;&#x000A;A compact workbench is tucked against the eastern wall, strewn with tools and coiled wires. Above it, shelves are stacked with neatly labeled replacement parts: fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded diagram of the ride's layout is pinned to the wall nearby, marked with annotations in red ink from previous maintenance efforts.&#x000A;&#x000A;The lighting is dimmer here, provided by a single hanging bulb that casts soft shadows across the room. The air feels cooler and slightly damp, with a faint smell of mildew mixing with the metallic tang of the machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;The north mechanical room functions as a support system, ensuring that auxiliary processes run smoothly and that emergency backups are ready to deploy if needed. Though quieter and less imposing than its southern counterpart, it is just as critical to the ride's overall operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[88] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel locks, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[89] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel locks: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[90] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the heart of the carnival ride, a large, noisy space where the primary systems are housed. The room is dominated by a massive motor, its rhythmic hum filling the air as it drives the ride's main mechanics. Thick belts and pulleys extend from the motor to a series of gears and drive shafts, each component working in seamless coordination to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with heavy-duty electrical panels, their surfaces marked with warning labels like "High Voltage" and "Do Not Open While Powered". Bright indicator lights blink in greens and reds, providing a visual heartbeat to the room's constant activity. Overhead, insulated wires and steel conduits run along the ceiling, their routes clearly labeled but seemingly endless.&#x000A;&#x000A;A workbench along one wall is cluttered with tools-wrenches, screwdrivers, and pliers-neatly arranged next to containers of spare parts like bolts, washers, and lubricants. Manuals and maintenance logs sit open, their pages marked with grease-stained fingerprints. The faint smell of oil and metal pervades the air, along with a hint of ozone from the electrical systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan whirs in the corner, its blades spinning in a futile attempt to temper the room's warmth. The sound of chains clinking occasionally breaks through the hum, accompanied by the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid releasing pressure. The floor is a patchwork of metal grates and concrete, worn smooth in some areas by years of use.&#x000A;&#x000A;The south mechanical room is brightly lit, with overhead fluorescent lights encased in protective wire cages. This is the main operations hub, where the power of the ride is generated and controlled, ensuring its thrilling movements stay in sync.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[91] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;The generator room is a compact, industrial space tucked away from the vibrant chaos of the carnival, where the hum and flicker of electricity are birthed to power the attractions. The walls are constructed of reinforced concrete, their surfaces marked with grime, oil streaks, and the faint outlines of graffiti left by past workers. The room smells of diesel fuel, hot metal, and the faint tang of ozone, mingled with the earthy scent of dampness from the surrounding ground.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center of the room sits the main generator, a hulking, metallic beast of machinery. Its steel casing is scuffed and dented from years of use, though it still functions with a steady, low rumble that resonates through the floor. Thick cables, black and rubberized, extend like veins from the generator to the room's walls, where they feed into an array of junction boxes and circuit breakers.&#x000A;&#x000A;The generator's control panel is mounted to one side, cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges. Labels, many peeling or faded, identify each component: "Fuel Intake", "Voltage Control", "Emergency Shutoff". A small display screen flickers with real-time readouts, showing power levels and load distribution to the various carnival attractions.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is made of rough, uneven concrete, with small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation pooling in its crevices. Along the walls, shelves are stacked with spare parts-fuel filters, spark plugs, and coils of insulated wire. Tools are scattered on a nearby workbench, alongside a canister of grease and a well-worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is thick and warm, vibrating faintly with the generator's operation. A vent in the corner struggles to extract the heat, its fan spinning with a faint, rhythmic whir. The dim lighting in the room comes from a single industrial bulb encased in a protective cage, casting harsh shadows across the machinery and walls.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a row of diesel fuel canisters stands neatly arranged, their metallic surfaces gleaming under the light. A faded safety poster hangs above them, its message barely legible: "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its utilitarian design, the room carries an air of importance. The generator room is the heartbeat of the carnival, its steady output ensuring that the lights flash, the rides whirl, and the sounds of joy and terror continue uninterrupted. Yet, in its stark isolation, it feels oddly disconnected from the lively world it powers, a quiet reminder of the machinery behind the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[92] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a compact but vital space, tucked away behind the scenes of the carnival's bustling attractions. The room hums with a steady, electric energy, the air thick with the scent of overheated wires, metal, and a faint tang of ozone. The walls are lined with metal panels, some polished and sleek, others weathered and streaked with grease from years of operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel dominates one wall, its surface covered in a grid of switches and levers, each labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights", "Carousel Motors", and "Midway Games". Bright indicator lights blink sporadically, casting green, yellow, and red glows that reflect off the polished steel surfaces. Overhead, conduits and thick bundles of cables snake across the ceiling, bound together with zip ties and disappearing into the walls to distribute power throughout the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner of the room, a junction box sits open, its wires spilling out like the veins of the carnival. A maintenance worker's touch lingers here, with tools scattered on a small workbench nearby: wire cutters, screwdrivers, and spools of electrical tape. A laminated wiring diagram is pinned to the wall above the bench, its corners dog-eared and smudged with greasy fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is dirt, its surface marked with scratches, oil stains, and scattered bits of wire clippings. A faint vibration runs through the room, a pulse from the generator in the adjacent space or the distant hum of the carnival rides.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mounted along another wall is an emergency shutdown panel, painted bright red with a prominent lever labeled "Master Power Off." A fire extinguisher hangs nearby, accompanied by a faded safety poster warning about the dangers of electrical fires. Below it, a collection of replacement fuses and circuit boards are neatly arranged on a shelf, ready for use when something inevitably malfunctions.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small fan sits on the workbench, oscillating weakly to counter the oppressive heat radiating from the machinery. The light in the room comes from bare fluorescent tubes overhead, their cold glow flickering slightly, casting sharp shadows that shift with every movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its functionality, the electrical room carries a certain unease. The constant hum of electricity, the flicker of lights, and the sharpness of exposed wires hint at the delicate balance of power keeping the carnival alive. It's a space where the magic of the midway is stripped bare, revealing the raw energy coursing through its veins.&#x000A;&#x000A;This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous! There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[93] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;You are in a section of the electrical room. There is an electrical panel here.

The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door and a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[106] l under stocks&#x000A;You find the aqua fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[107] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door, a ladder, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[108] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[109] w&#x000A;(first opening the crimson door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the crimson door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[110] l under platform&#x000A;You find the crimson fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[111] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[112] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[113] w&#x000A;(first opening the emerald door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the emerald door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[114] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is an emerald fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[115] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[116] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[117] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[118] w&#x000A;(first opening the gray door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the gray door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[119] l under seat&#x000A;You find the gray fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[120] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[121] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[122] w&#x000A;(first opening the indigo door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the indigo door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"This man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door and a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[123] l under platform&#x000A;You find the indigo fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[124] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[125] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[126] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a chaotic yet oddly functional space, tucked away from the flashing lights and lively crowds. Its walls are made of corrugated metal or weathered wood, with patches of rust and peeling paint revealing the room's age. The faint smell of grease, dust, and damp canvas hangs in the air, mingled with a hint of stale popcorn and cotton candy from the midway outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves line the walls, crammed with a mishmash of supplies. Boxes of lightbulbs, spools of electrical wiring, and stacks of replacement parts for rides and games are piled haphazardly, some labeled in fading marker, others left to mystery. A collection of brightly colored pennant flags and strings of carnival lights dangles from hooks, their wires tangled into an unruly knot.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a pile of folded canvas tarps and tent poles leans precariously against the wall, ready to be deployed for setting up new attractions or repairing existing ones. Nearby, over sized crates are labeled with blocky stencils: "GAME PRIZES", RIDE PARTS", and "SPARE SIGNAGE". One crate is open, revealing a jumble of stuffed animals, rubber balls, and plastic toys meant to delight lucky winners.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by larger items-spare seats for rides, unassembled game booths, and the occasional disassembled attraction part, like a faded carousel horse or a section of a Ferris wheel's gondola. These are covered in tarps or wrapped in protective blankets, their surfaces scratched and worn from transport and use.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small, battered desk sits near the entrance, cluttered with maintenance logs, mismatched tools, and a few empty coffee cups. Above it, a cork board displays a chaotic array of pinned notes: ride schedules, repair requests, and a map of the carnival grounds with certain areas circled in red. A single fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting uneven shadows across the room and giving it a slightly eerie feel.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of concrete and dirt, strewn with stray bolts, screws, and scraps of paper. In the darker corners, the scuttling of a rat or the glint of a spider's web serves as a reminder that this space, while essential, is far from pristine.&#x000A;&#x000A;The carnival storage room is not glamorous, but it is vital-a hidden world of spare parts, forgotten treasures, and organized chaos that keeps the carnival running smoothly. It's a backstage glimpse into the hard work and improvisation that make the magic possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[127] w&#x000A;(first opening the khaki door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the khaki door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is as unsettling as the ride itself, designed to leave riders with a lingering sense of unease. The pathway emerges from a dark, narrow corridor, its walls painted in peeling black with streaks of red that resemble dripping blood. Dim, flickering lights cast erratic shadows across the uneven floor, creating an oppressive atmosphere that follows riders even after they've left the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is cooler here, with a faint metallic tang and the unmistakable scent of dampness, as though the exit leads not back to the carnival but somewhere deeper underground. Sound effects of faint whispers and distant screams play softly in the background, barely audible over the creak of the exit door swinging open and the occasional burst of laughter or screams from the ride's next passengers.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step out into a small courtyard, enclosed by jagged, rusted metal fencing adorned with fake cobwebs and plastic bones. A weathered sign swings overhead, painted in bold, Gothic letters: "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now."&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a few carnival workers in tattered costumes linger, their expressions disturbingly neutral as they watch riders leave. One might mumble cryptic phrases like, "Not everyone makes it out&#x2026;" before breaking into a crooked grin.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit path leads past a small merchandise stand selling ride-themed merchandise-"Hell Ride Survivor" t-shirts, devil horns, and glow-in-the-dark trinkets shaped like skulls. The stand is bathed in red light, adding to the ominous mood.&#x000A;&#x000A;Just beyond the fencing, the cheerful sounds and colorful lights of the carnival midway feel jarringly out of place, a sharp contrast to the oppressive darkness of the ride. Riders often pause to gather themselves, exchanging nervous laughter or adjusting their belongings, before stepping back into the lively world of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Hell Ride exit leaves riders not just thrilled, but marked by the eerie experience, a reminder of the fine line between fun and fear that defines the carnival's darkest attraction.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[128] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand is a khaki fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[129] get khaki fuse from merchandise stand&#x000A;You find nothing!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[130] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[131] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[132] test b3&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[133] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[134] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[135] put aqua in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[136] push switch&#x000A;The indicator light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[137] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[138] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;You are in a section of the electrical room.

It's where the real work happens-a nerve center for monitoring and managing the operations of the rides, attractions, and lighting systems. The room is enclosed by plain, industrial walls, painted a dull gray and marked with scuffs, scratches, and the occasional smudge of grease or fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rows of monitors line the main wall, displaying live feeds from security cameras and ride controls. Each screen shows a different part of the carnival: blinking lights of the Ferris wheel, the whirling motion of a carousel, and the eerie darkness of the Hell Ride. A few screens flicker or show static, adding to the sense of wear and tear that pervades the room. Beneath the monitors, a control panel is cluttered with switches, buttons, and dials, each labeled with functions like "Ride Start," "Lighting Override", and "Emergency Stop." Small lights blink in green, yellow, or red, signaling the status of different systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics fills the air, mingled with the occasional crackle of a two-way radio resting on a desk. The radios buzz intermittently with the voices of carnival workers reporting issues or coordinating movements: "Maintenance to Tilt-a-Whirl-need a wrench at Station 2!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of worn linoleum and exposed concrete, littered with stray papers, toolkits, and empty coffee cups. A cluttered desk sits against one wall, covered with logbooks, ride schedules, and laminated emergency procedures. A corkboard above the desk is pinned with maintenance charts, carnival maps, and handwritten notes, some of them circled in red ink with messages like "Check circuit breakers on Zipper" or "Replace bulbs near south entrance."&#x000A;&#x000A;A single fluorescent light fixture hangs overhead, buzzing faintly as it casts a cold, sterile glow across the room. The air is cool but tinged with a faint metallic smell, mixed with the earthy dampness from the surrounding carnival grounds. In one corner, a small, battered first-aid kit hangs on the wall, its contents slightly spilling out, and a faded fire extinguisher sits nearby.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its unassuming appearance, the control room feels alive with purpose-a behind-the-scenes hub that ensures the carnival's magic unfolds without a hitch. It's a space where the mechanics, electronics, and human effort merge to keep the carnival running smoothly, even as chaos and excitement reign outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Control Panel here.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[179] l at control panel&#x000A;The control panel is populated with a row of colored lights.

Its exterior is painted in bright red and yellow stripes, with bold, blocky letters above the window that read "Tickets Here!" Strings of twinkling lights outline the edges, blinking in rhythmic patterns to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk is compact, with a single window where a smiling attendant greets visitors. Behind the glass, rows of ticket rolls in vibrant colors - blue, red, and yellow - are neatly arranged in dispensers. A small cash drawer sits open beside them, jingling softly as the attendant counts out change. To the side of the window, a digital payment system is set up for those who prefer modern convenience, its screen glowing faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;A colorful signboard is propped up next to the kiosk, listing ticket prices for rides, games, and attractions. At the top, in bold letters, it reads: "Step Right Up! Your Adventure Awaits!" Below, the list of options is accompanied by playful illustrations of roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and cotton candy.&#x000A;&#x000A;The kiosk roof juts out slightly, providing shelter to visitors during rain or shine. Bright pennant flags are strung from the corners of the roof to nearby poles, fluttering in the breeze and adding to the festive atmosphere. The smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts through the air, carried over from nearby food stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground around the kiosk is well-trodden, with patches of worn grass and compacted dirt revealing the heavy foot traffic of eager carnival-goers. A line of families, couples, and groups of friends forms in front of the kiosk, buzzing with excitement as they wait their turn to purchase tickets.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ticket kiosk is more than just a point of entry-it's the first step into the carnival's magic, where anticipation builds and the promise of thrills and wonders begins to take shape.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues east and west from here.

To the south is the track that will take you into the ride. The safety bar is raised allowing you to enter the car. The darkness looks just a little bit darker.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] enter car&#x000A;You get into the car.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] wait&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The car moves forward and the safety bar begins to lower.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Entrance&#x000A;The car has begun to move toward the entrance of the ride and the safety bar has been lowered. The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 5 out of a possible 100, in 16 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The darkness looks just a little bit darker.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a car (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] enter car&#x000A;You get into the car.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] wait&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The car moves forward and the safety bar begins to lower.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Entrance&#x000A;The car has begun to move toward the entrance of the ride and the safety bar has been lowered. The entrance to Hell Ride is a chilling spectacle designed to draw both thrill-seekers and the morbidly curious. The facade looms before you, a grotesque masterpiece of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering, blood-red lights that cast eerie shadows across the ground. The air smells faintly of sulfur, mingling with the sweet scent of carnival popcorn from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway frames the entrance, its design a chaotic blend of flames, jagged spikes, and sinister, grinning skulls. The words "HELL RIDE" are emblazoned above in glowing, flickering letters that seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Beneath the sign, two sculpted demons crouch, their clawed hands extending outward as though inviting-or daring-you to enter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dark curtains, frayed and stained, hang over the entrance, swaying faintly in a breeze that seems to carry whispers and low, menacing chuckles. As you approach, the faint sound of distorted organ music grows louder, interspersed with sudden shrieks and the grinding of unseen machinery. A crooked sign at the side reads: "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a carnival barker with a waxen smile stands under a sputtering gaslight, his voice raspy and theatrical: "Step right up, brave souls! Take the ride of your life-or your afterlife! The gates of hell are open, and the darkness beckons!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Through the entrance, the interior is shrouded in near-total darkness, save for flashes of sickly green light that illuminate the suggestion of twisting paths and grotesque shapes. The only certainty is that once you step inside, there's no turning back from the horrors that await.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is an open expanse of cobblestones, surrounded by the weathered facades of timber-framed buildings. The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"his man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 5 out of a possible 100, in 16 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>

A strong, narrow beam of light shines from the flashlight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The maintenance office is a chaotic and dimly lit space tucked away behind the glitz and glamour of the carnival. It smells of grease, sweat, and faintly of popcorn from the midway outside. The air is heavy and warm, thick with the lingering scent of oil and dust stirred up by constant work.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with cluttered shelves holding an assortment of tools and parts-rusty wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, bolts, and screws organized (or not) in mismatched containers. Tattered labels, some scrawled in fading marker, hint at what lies inside. Cans of paint, grease, and lubricant sit precariously on the edges of workbenches, their lids half-open or missing entirely.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by a large desk scarred with years of use. A vise clamp holds a bent piece of metal in place, while a spread of loose wires, gears, and springs litter the surface. A single, broken fluorescent light hangs from the ceiling.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism sits, its inner workings exposed like the guts of a machine. Chains and pulleys dangle from hooks overhead, their metallic clink echoing faintly as they sway slightly with the vibration of the rides outside. A half-drained mug of coffee sits forgotten on a stool nearby, next to a grease-stained manual lying open to a random page.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls bear evidence of the room's purpose: faded safety posters warning of hazards, a cork board pinned with ride maintenance schedules and hastily scribbled notes, and a faded photograph of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly in the background, though its hands don't seem to match the current time.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is uneven and gritty, coated in a fine layer of dust and littered with stray nails and scraps of metal. In one corner, a toolbox sits half-open, its contents spilling out as though abandoned mid-task. Nearby, a rickety fan struggles to spin, offering little relief from the oppressive heat.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the disarray, the room hums with purpose. This is the beating heart of the carnival's machinery, a hidden realm where the magic of the attractions is kept alive by grease-stained hands and sheer determination.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio is off.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a ladder, an aqua door, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] turn on radio&#x000A;You flip a switch. Through the static, you pick up hear bits of the latest Taylor Swift song.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] l at desk&#x000A;It's a desk. There are coffee stains and cigarette burns from years of abuse. The single drawer is shut.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The DJ just cued up Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] open drawer&#x000A;You open the drawer, revealing a scissors, a stapler, a ballpoint pen, and a pad of paper.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] get all from the drawer&#x000A;scissors: Taken.&#x000A;stapler: Taken.&#x000A;ballpoint pen: Taken.&#x000A;pad of paper: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash is on the air."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;The crawl space beneath the carnival ride is a tight, claustrophobic tunnel shrouded in darkness and filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is smaller and more focused, housing the auxiliary systems that support the ride's operation. It's quieter than the south room, though the hum of capacitors and relays creates a constant, low background noise. Rows of electrical panels line the walls, each labeled with functions such as "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems", and "Emergency Shutdown". Smaller cables and conduits run along the walls, connecting these systems to the main hub in the south room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir control specific mechanisms of the ride, such as lifting arms or rotating platforms. Pressure gauges flicker intermittently, and the occasional hiss of fluid escaping creates a sharp contrast to the otherwise subdued atmosphere. A small generator sits nearby, its housing slightly dented but functional, ready to activate in case of a power failure.&#x000A;&#x000A;A compact workbench is tucked against the eastern wall, strewn with tools and coiled wires. Above it, shelves are stacked with neatly labeled replacement parts: fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded diagram of the ride's layout is pinned to the wall nearby, marked with annotations in red ink from previous maintenance efforts.&#x000A;&#x000A;The lighting is dimmer here, provided by a single hanging bulb that casts soft shadows across the room. The air feels cooler and slightly damp, with a faint smell of mildew mixing with the metallic tang of the machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;The north mechanical room functions as a support system, ensuring that auxiliary processes run smoothly and that emergency backups are ready to deploy if needed. Though quieter and less imposing than its southern counterpart, it is just as critical to the ride's overall operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel locks, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel locks: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the heart of the carnival ride, a large, noisy space where the primary systems are housed. The room is dominated by a massive motor, its rhythmic hum filling the air as it drives the ride's main mechanics. Thick belts and pulleys extend from the motor to a series of gears and drive shafts, each component working in seamless coordination to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with heavy-duty electrical panels, their surfaces marked with warning labels like "High Voltage" and "Do Not Open While Powered". Bright indicator lights blink in greens and reds, providing a visual heartbeat to the room's constant activity. Overhead, insulated wires and steel conduits run along the ceiling, their routes clearly labeled but seemingly endless.&#x000A;&#x000A;A workbench along one wall is cluttered with tools-wrenches, screwdrivers, and pliers-neatly arranged next to containers of spare parts like bolts, washers, and lubricants. Manuals and maintenance logs sit open, their pages marked with grease-stained fingerprints. The faint smell of oil and metal pervades the air, along with a hint of ozone from the electrical systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan whirs in the corner, its blades spinning in a futile attempt to temper the room's warmth. The sound of chains clinking occasionally breaks through the hum, accompanied by the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid releasing pressure. The floor is a patchwork of metal grates and concrete, worn smooth in some areas by years of use.&#x000A;&#x000A;The south mechanical room is brightly lit, with overhead fluorescent lights encased in protective wire cages. This is the main operations hub, where the power of the ride is generated and controlled, ensuring its thrilling movements stay in sync.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;The generator room is a compact, industrial space tucked away from the vibrant chaos of the carnival, where the hum and flicker of electricity are birthed to power the attractions. The walls are constructed of reinforced concrete, their surfaces marked with grime, oil streaks, and the faint outlines of graffiti left by past workers. The room smells of diesel fuel, hot metal, and the faint tang of ozone, mingled with the earthy scent of dampness from the surrounding ground.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center of the room sits the main generator, a hulking, metallic beast of machinery. Its steel casing is scuffed and dented from years of use, though it still functions with a steady, low rumble that resonates through the floor. Thick cables, black and rubberized, extend like veins from the generator to the room's walls, where they feed into an array of junction boxes and circuit breakers.&#x000A;&#x000A;The generator's control panel is mounted to one side, cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges. Labels, many peeling or faded, identify each component: "Fuel Intake", "Voltage Control", "Emergency Shutoff". A small display screen flickers with real-time readouts, showing power levels and load distribution to the various carnival attractions.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is made of rough, uneven concrete, with small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation pooling in its crevices. Along the walls, shelves are stacked with spare parts-fuel filters, spark plugs, and coils of insulated wire. Tools are scattered on a nearby workbench, alongside a canister of grease and a well-worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is thick and warm, vibrating faintly with the generator's operation. A vent in the corner struggles to extract the heat, its fan spinning with a faint, rhythmic whir. The dim lighting in the room comes from a single industrial bulb encased in a protective cage, casting harsh shadows across the machinery and walls.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a row of diesel fuel canisters stands neatly arranged, their metallic surfaces gleaming under the light. A faded safety poster hangs above them, its message barely legible: "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its utilitarian design, the room carries an air of importance. The generator room is the heartbeat of the carnival, its steady output ensuring that the lights flash, the rides whirl, and the sounds of joy and terror continue uninterrupted. Yet, in its stark isolation, it feels oddly disconnected from the lively world it powers, a quiet reminder of the machinery behind the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a compact but vital space, tucked away behind the scenes of the carnival's bustling attractions. The room hums with a steady, electric energy, the air thick with the scent of overheated wires, metal, and a faint tang of ozone. The walls are lined with metal panels, some polished and sleek, others weathered and streaked with grease from years of operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel dominates one wall, its surface covered in a grid of switches and levers, each labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights", "Carousel Motors", and "Midway Games". Bright indicator lights blink sporadically, casting green, yellow, and red glows that reflect off the polished steel surfaces. Overhead, conduits and thick bundles of cables snake across the ceiling, bound together with zip ties and disappearing into the walls to distribute power throughout the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner of the room, a junction box sits open, its wires spilling out like the veins of the carnival. A maintenance worker's touch lingers here, with tools scattered on a small workbench nearby: wire cutters, screwdrivers, and spools of electrical tape. A laminated wiring diagram is pinned to the wall above the bench, its corners dog-eared and smudged with greasy fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is dirt, its surface marked with scratches, oil stains, and scattered bits of wire clippings. A faint vibration runs through the room, a pulse from the generator in the adjacent space or the distant hum of the carnival rides.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mounted along another wall is an emergency shutdown panel, painted bright red with a prominent lever labeled "Master Power Off." A fire extinguisher hangs nearby, accompanied by a faded safety poster warning about the dangers of electrical fires. Below it, a collection of replacement fuses and circuit boards are neatly arranged on a shelf, ready for use when something inevitably malfunctions.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small fan sits on the workbench, oscillating weakly to counter the oppressive heat radiating from the machinery. The light in the room comes from bare fluorescent tubes overhead, their cold glow flickering slightly, casting sharp shadows that shift with every movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its functionality, the electrical room carries a certain unease. The constant hum of electricity, the flicker of lights, and the sharpness of exposed wires hint at the delicate balance of power keeping the carnival alive. It's a space where the magic of the midway is stripped bare, revealing the raw energy coursing through its veins.&#x000A;&#x000A;This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous! There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;You are in a section of the electrical room. There is an electrical panel here.

The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door and a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] l under stocks&#x000A;You find the aqua fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door, a ladder, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[40] w&#x000A;(first opening the crimson door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the crimson door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[41] l under platform&#x000A;You find the crimson fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[44] w&#x000A;(first opening the emerald door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the emerald door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is an emerald fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[46] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[47] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] w&#x000A;(first opening the gray door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the gray door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] l under seat&#x000A;You find the gray fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[51] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[53] w&#x000A;(first opening the indigo door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the indigo door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle. The sky overhead is a patchwork of gray clouds, casting the cobblestone ground in a somber light. At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"This man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door and a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[54] l under platform&#x000A;You find the indigo fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[55] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[57] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a chaotic yet oddly functional space, tucked away from the flashing lights and lively crowds. Its walls are made of corrugated metal or weathered wood, with patches of rust and peeling paint revealing the room's age. The faint smell of grease, dust, and damp canvas hangs in the air, mingled with a hint of stale popcorn and cotton candy from the midway outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves line the walls, crammed with a mishmash of supplies. Boxes of lightbulbs, spools of electrical wiring, and stacks of replacement parts for rides and games are piled haphazardly, some labeled in fading marker, others left to mystery. A collection of brightly colored pennant flags and strings of carnival lights dangles from hooks, their wires tangled into an unruly knot.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a pile of folded canvas tarps and tent poles leans precariously against the wall, ready to be deployed for setting up new attractions or repairing existing ones. Nearby, over sized crates are labeled with blocky stencils: "GAME PRIZES", RIDE PARTS", and "SPARE SIGNAGE". One crate is open, revealing a jumble of stuffed animals, rubber balls, and plastic toys meant to delight lucky winners.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by larger items-spare seats for rides, unassembled game booths, and the occasional disassembled attraction part, like a faded carousel horse or a section of a Ferris wheel's gondola. These are covered in tarps or wrapped in protective blankets, their surfaces scratched and worn from transport and use.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small, battered desk sits near the entrance, cluttered with maintenance logs, mismatched tools, and a few empty coffee cups. Above it, a cork board displays a chaotic array of pinned notes: ride schedules, repair requests, and a map of the carnival grounds with certain areas circled in red. A single fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting uneven shadows across the room and giving it a slightly eerie feel.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of concrete and dirt, strewn with stray bolts, screws, and scraps of paper. In the darker corners, the scuttling of a rat or the glint of a spider's web serves as a reminder that this space, while essential, is far from pristine.&#x000A;&#x000A;The carnival storage room is not glamorous, but it is vital-a hidden world of spare parts, forgotten treasures, and organized chaos that keeps the carnival running smoothly. It's a backstage glimpse into the hard work and improvisation that make the magic possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[58] w&#x000A;(first opening the khaki door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the khaki door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is as unsettling as the ride itself, designed to leave riders with a lingering sense of unease. The pathway emerges from a dark, narrow corridor, its walls painted in peeling black with streaks of red that resemble dripping blood. Dim, flickering lights cast erratic shadows across the uneven floor, creating an oppressive atmosphere that follows riders even after they've left the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is cooler here, with a faint metallic tang and the unmistakable scent of dampness, as though the exit leads not back to the carnival but somewhere deeper underground. Sound effects of faint whispers and distant screams play softly in the background, barely audible over the creak of the exit door swinging open and the occasional burst of laughter or screams from the ride's next passengers.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step out into a small courtyard, enclosed by jagged, rusted metal fencing adorned with fake cobwebs and plastic bones. A weathered sign swings overhead, painted in bold, Gothic letters: "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now."&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a few carnival workers in tattered costumes linger, their expressions disturbingly neutral as they watch riders leave. One might mumble cryptic phrases like, "Not everyone makes it out&#x2026;" before breaking into a crooked grin.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit path leads past a small merchandise stand selling ride-themed merchandise-"Hell Ride Survivor" t-shirts, devil horns, and glow-in-the-dark trinkets shaped like skulls. The stand is bathed in red light, adding to the ominous mood.&#x000A;&#x000A;Just beyond the fencing, the cheerful sounds and colorful lights of the carnival midway feel jarringly out of place, a sharp contrast to the oppressive darkness of the ride. Riders often pause to gather themselves, exchanging nervous laughter or adjusting their belongings, before stepping back into the lively world of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Hell Ride exit leaves riders not just thrilled, but marked by the eerie experience, a reminder of the fine line between fun and fear that defines the carnival's darkest attraction.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[59] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand is a khaki fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[60] get khaki fuse from merchandise stand&#x000A;You find nothing!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[61] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[62] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[63] test b3&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[64] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[65] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[66] put aqua in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[67] push switch&#x000A;The indicator light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[68] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[69] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;You are in a section of the electrical room.

It's where the real work happens-a nerve center for monitoring and managing the operations of the rides, attractions, and lighting systems. The room is enclosed by plain, industrial walls, painted a dull gray and marked with scuffs, scratches, and the occasional smudge of grease or fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rows of monitors line the main wall, displaying live feeds from security cameras and ride controls. Each screen shows a different part of the carnival: blinking lights of the Ferris wheel, the whirling motion of a carousel, and the eerie darkness of the Hell Ride. A few screens flicker or show static, adding to the sense of wear and tear that pervades the room. Beneath the monitors, a control panel is cluttered with switches, buttons, and dials, each labeled with functions like "Ride Start," "Lighting Override", and "Emergency Stop." Small lights blink in green, yellow, or red, signaling the status of different systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics fills the air, mingled with the occasional crackle of a two-way radio resting on a desk. The radios buzz intermittently with the voices of carnival workers reporting issues or coordinating movements: "Maintenance to Tilt-a-Whirl-need a wrench at Station 2!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of worn linoleum and exposed concrete, littered with stray papers, toolkits, and empty coffee cups. A cluttered desk sits against one wall, covered with logbooks, ride schedules, and laminated emergency procedures. A corkboard above the desk is pinned with maintenance charts, carnival maps, and handwritten notes, some of them circled in red ink with messages like "Check circuit breakers on Zipper" or "Replace bulbs near south entrance."&#x000A;&#x000A;A single fluorescent light fixture hangs overhead, buzzing faintly as it casts a cold, sterile glow across the room. The air is cool but tinged with a faint metallic smell, mixed with the earthy dampness from the surrounding carnival grounds. In one corner, a small, battered first-aid kit hangs on the wall, its contents slightly spilling out, and a faded fire extinguisher sits nearby.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its unassuming appearance, the control room feels alive with purpose-a behind-the-scenes hub that ensures the carnival's magic unfolds without a hitch. It's a space where the mechanics, electronics, and human effort merge to keep the carnival running smoothly, even as chaos and excitement reign outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Control Panel here.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[110] l at control panel&#x000A;The control panel is populated with a row of colored lights.

A strong, narrow beam of light shines from the flashlight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The maintenance office is a chaotic and dimly lit space tucked away behind the glitz and glamour of the carnival. It smells of grease, sweat, and faintly of popcorn from the midway outside. The air is heavy and warm, thick with the lingering scent of oil and dust stirred up by constant work.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with cluttered shelves holding an assortment of tools and parts-rusty wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, bolts, and screws organized (or not) in mismatched containers. Tattered labels, some scrawled in fading marker, hint at what lies inside. Cans of paint, grease, and lubricant sit precariously on the edges of workbenches, their lids half-open or missing entirely.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by a large desk scarred with years of use. A vise clamp holds a bent piece of metal in place, while a spread of loose wires, gears, and springs litter the surface. A single, broken fluorescent light hangs from the ceiling.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism sits, its inner workings exposed like the guts of a machine. Chains and pulleys dangle from hooks overhead, their metallic clink echoing faintly as they sway slightly with the vibration of the rides outside. A half-drained mug of coffee sits forgotten on a stool nearby, next to a grease-stained manual lying open to a random page.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls bear evidence of the room's purpose: faded safety posters warning of hazards, a cork board pinned with ride maintenance schedules and hastily scribbled notes, and a faded photograph of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly in the background, though its hands don't seem to match the current time.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is uneven and gritty, coated in a fine layer of dust and littered with stray nails and scraps of metal. In one corner, a toolbox sits half-open, its contents spilling out as though abandoned mid-task. Nearby, a rickety fan struggles to spin, offering little relief from the oppressive heat.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the disarray, the room hums with purpose. This is the beating heart of the carnival's machinery, a hidden realm where the magic of the attractions is kept alive by grease-stained hands and sheer determination.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio is off.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a ladder, an aqua door, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] turn on radio&#x000A;You flip a switch.

The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is smaller and more focused, housing the auxiliary systems that support the ride's operation. It's quieter than the south room, though the hum of capacitors and relays creates a constant, low background noise. Rows of electrical panels line the walls, each labeled with functions such as "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems", and "Emergency Shutdown". Smaller cables and conduits run along the walls, connecting these systems to the main hub in the south room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir control specific mechanisms of the ride, such as lifting arms or rotating platforms. Pressure gauges flicker intermittently, and the occasional hiss of fluid escaping creates a sharp contrast to the otherwise subdued atmosphere. A small generator sits nearby, its housing slightly dented but functional, ready to activate in case of a power failure.&#x000A;&#x000A;A compact workbench is tucked against the eastern wall, strewn with tools and coiled wires. Above it, shelves are stacked with neatly labeled replacement parts: fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded diagram of the ride's layout is pinned to the wall nearby, marked with annotations in red ink from previous maintenance efforts.&#x000A;&#x000A;The lighting is dimmer here, provided by a single hanging bulb that casts soft shadows across the room. The air feels cooler and slightly damp, with a faint smell of mildew mixing with the metallic tang of the machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;The north mechanical room functions as a support system, ensuring that auxiliary processes run smoothly and that emergency backups are ready to deploy if needed. Though quieter and less imposing than its southern counterpart, it is just as critical to the ride's overall operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel locks, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel locks: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the heart of the carnival ride, a large, noisy space where the primary systems are housed. The room is dominated by a massive motor, its rhythmic hum filling the air as it drives the ride's main mechanics. Thick belts and pulleys extend from the motor to a series of gears and drive shafts, each component working in seamless coordination to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with heavy-duty electrical panels, their surfaces marked with warning labels like "High Voltage" and "Do Not Open While Powered". Bright indicator lights blink in greens and reds, providing a visual heartbeat to the room's constant activity. Overhead, insulated wires and steel conduits run along the ceiling, their routes clearly labeled but seemingly endless.&#x000A;&#x000A;A workbench along one wall is cluttered with tools-wrenches, screwdrivers, and pliers-neatly arranged next to containers of spare parts like bolts, washers, and lubricants. Manuals and maintenance logs sit open, their pages marked with grease-stained fingerprints. The faint smell of oil and metal pervades the air, along with a hint of ozone from the electrical systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan whirs in the corner, its blades spinning in a futile attempt to temper the room's warmth. The sound of chains clinking occasionally breaks through the hum, accompanied by the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid releasing pressure. The floor is a patchwork of metal grates and concrete, worn smooth in some areas by years of use.&#x000A;&#x000A;The south mechanical room is brightly lit, with overhead fluorescent lights encased in protective wire cages. This is the main operations hub, where the power of the ride is generated and controlled, ensuring its thrilling movements stay in sync.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;The generator room is a compact, industrial space tucked away from the vibrant chaos of the carnival, where the hum and flicker of electricity are birthed to power the attractions. The walls are constructed of reinforced concrete, their surfaces marked with grime, oil streaks, and the faint outlines of graffiti left by past workers. The room smells of diesel fuel, hot metal, and the faint tang of ozone, mingled with the earthy scent of dampness from the surrounding ground.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center of the room sits the main generator, a hulking, metallic beast of machinery. Its steel casing is scuffed and dented from years of use, though it still functions with a steady, low rumble that resonates through the floor. Thick cables, black and rubberized, extend like veins from the generator to the room's walls, where they feed into an array of junction boxes and circuit breakers.&#x000A;&#x000A;The generator's control panel is mounted to one side, cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges. Labels, many peeling or faded, identify each component: "Fuel Intake", "Voltage Control", "Emergency Shutoff". A small display screen flickers with real-time readouts, showing power levels and load distribution to the various carnival attractions.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is made of rough, uneven concrete, with small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation pooling in its crevices. Along the walls, shelves are stacked with spare parts-fuel filters, spark plugs, and coils of insulated wire. Tools are scattered on a nearby workbench, alongside a canister of grease and a well-worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is thick and warm, vibrating faintly with the generator's operation. A vent in the corner struggles to extract the heat, its fan spinning with a faint, rhythmic whir. The dim lighting in the room comes from a single industrial bulb encased in a protective cage, casting harsh shadows across the machinery and walls.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a row of diesel fuel canisters stands neatly arranged, their metallic surfaces gleaming under the light. A faded safety poster hangs above them, its message barely legible: "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its utilitarian design, the room carries an air of importance. The generator room is the heartbeat of the carnival, its steady output ensuring that the lights flash, the rides whirl, and the sounds of joy and terror continue uninterrupted. Yet, in its stark isolation, it feels oddly disconnected from the lively world it powers, a quiet reminder of the machinery behind the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a compact but vital space, tucked away behind the scenes of the carnival's bustling attractions. The room hums with a steady, electric energy, the air thick with the scent of overheated wires, metal, and a faint tang of ozone. The walls are lined with metal panels, some polished and sleek, others weathered and streaked with grease from years of operation.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel dominates one wall, its surface covered in a grid of switches and levers, each labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights", "Carousel Motors", and "Midway Games". Bright indicator lights blink sporadically, casting green, yellow, and red glows that reflect off the polished steel surfaces. Overhead, conduits and thick bundles of cables snake across the ceiling, bound together with zip ties and disappearing into the walls to distribute power throughout the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner of the room, a junction box sits open, its wires spilling out like the veins of the carnival. A maintenance worker's touch lingers here, with tools scattered on a small workbench nearby: wire cutters, screwdrivers, and spools of electrical tape. A laminated wiring diagram is pinned to the wall above the bench, its corners dog-eared and smudged with greasy fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is dirt, its surface marked with scratches, oil stains, and scattered bits of wire clippings. A faint vibration runs through the room, a pulse from the generator in the adjacent space or the distant hum of the carnival rides.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mounted along another wall is an emergency shutdown panel, painted bright red with a prominent lever labeled "Master Power Off." A fire extinguisher hangs nearby, accompanied by a faded safety poster warning about the dangers of electrical fires. Below it, a collection of replacement fuses and circuit boards are neatly arranged on a shelf, ready for use when something inevitably malfunctions.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small fan sits on the workbench, oscillating weakly to counter the oppressive heat radiating from the machinery. The light in the room comes from bare fluorescent tubes overhead, their cold glow flickering slightly, casting sharp shadows that shift with every movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its functionality, the electrical room carries a certain unease. The constant hum of electricity, the flicker of lights, and the sharpness of exposed wires hint at the delicate balance of power keeping the carnival alive. It's a space where the magic of the midway is stripped bare, revealing the raw energy coursing through its veins.&#x000A;&#x000A;This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous!

The air is heavy with the mingling scents of smoke from distant chimneys, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of the nearby smithy. At the square's center stand a row of crude wooden stocks, their heavy beams stained from years of weather and use. Iron clasps hold the unfortunate captives by their wrists and necks, their bodies forced into unnatural, humiliating postures.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals, heads bowed in shame, are caught in an agonizing tableau of disgrace. Their expressions, a mix of resignation and despair, reflect the full weight of their predicaments. Their clothing hangs in tatters, furthering their exposure to the biting wind and the sharp tongues of the gathered crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Around the stocks, the townsfolk revel in their collective cruelty. A wiry man leans in close, spitting insults with glee, his laughter cutting through the air. A stout woman clutching a basket of overripe vegetables hurls a squashed tomato, which splatters across one captive's cheek, drawing a chorus of jeers. Nearby, children mimic their elders, pointing and shrieking in mockery, their faces alight with mischief.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square is alive with noise: the raucous laughter of the crowd, the occasional sharp crack of a thrown object against the wood, and the soft, pained murmurs of the punished. A passing bell tolls faintly in the distance, but here it is drowned out by the cruel symphony of the jeering mob.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the gray sky looms, heavy with the promise of rain, as if nature itself disapproves of the spectacle. Yet the crowd pays no mind, delighting in their collective judgment, each jeer a reminder that today's entertainment is another's living nightmare.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door and a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] l under stocks&#x000A;You find the aqua fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an aqua door, a ladder, a desk, a cans of paint, grease, and lubricant here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[40] w&#x000A;(first opening the crimson door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the crimson door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square lies under a brooding, overcast sky, its cobblestones slick with the morning's drizzle. A grim silence has settled over the gathered crowd, broken only by the occasional murmur or the restless shuffling of feet. At the center of the square, rising like a grim monument to mortality, stands the gallows-a wooden platform, darkened by age and weather, with thick ropes hanging like vipers poised to strike.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atop the gallows, a hooded executioner looms, his imposing frame draped in a black cloak that billows faintly in the wind. His face is obscured by the deep cowl, but his presence radiates cold, methodical purpose. In his gloved hands, he adjusts the noose, its coarse fibers frayed from repeated use, ensuring it is ready for the task at hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;Standing beside him is the condemned man, his hands bound tightly behind his back. His face is pale, drawn, and haunted, beads of sweat mingling with the light rain. His eyes dart to the crowd, seeking pity, perhaps, but finding only a sea of indifferent faces. His breath comes in shallow bursts, each exhalation visible in the chilly air, a stark reminder of the life still in him-for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd gathers in a semicircle around the platform, a mixture of somber onlookers, opportunistic vendors hawking bread and cider, and children craning their necks for a better view. An old man mutters a prayer under his breath, clutching a rosary, while a group of rough-looking men smirk and exchange bets on how long the drop will take.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime echoing through the square, a countdown to the inevitable. The condemned man flinches with each clang, his shoulders tensing as the final moments draw near. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its black eyes unblinking, as if waiting for the end with morbid curiosity.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner steps forward, adjusting the noose around the man's neck with a practiced efficiency. The crowd falls silent, the weight of the moment hanging heavier than the rope itself. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbles faintly, as though the heavens themselves are bracing for what is to come.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a crimson door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[41] l under platform&#x000A;You find the crimson fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see a crimson door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[44] w&#x000A;(first opening the emerald door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the emerald door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is a grim tableau, the usual bustle of commerce and chatter replaced with an oppressive silence broken only by the crackling of the flames. At the center, three wooden stakes rise ominously from a circular pyre of logs and kindling, their rough surfaces darkened by smoke from countless such scenes before. Bound tightly to these stakes are three women, their wrists and ankles secured with coarse, heavy ropes. Their faces tell different stories-one of defiance, another of resignation, and the third of pure terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the pyre, their expressions a mix of morbid fascination, righteous fury, and hesitant pity. Children cling to their mothers" skirts, staring wide-eyed, while town elders nod solemnly as though approving the grim spectacle. Some townsfolk jeer loudly, throwing small stones or rotten vegetables at the condemned. Others murmur prayers or make the sign of the cross, their eyes averted.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, clad in a soot-streaked hood and leather apron, steps forward, his torch a blazing beacon in the dreary scene. The flames dance and writhe as he lowers the torch to the base of the pyre, igniting the dry wood with a sudden, hungry roar. A cheer erupts from a faction of the crowd, while others fall into an uneasy silence, watching the fire climb higher.&#x000A;&#x000A;Thick, acrid smoke begins to rise, curling around the stakes like a living thing. The women cry out-some in curses, others in prayers-and their voices echo across the square, mingling with the crackle of the flames. The heat radiates outward, and even those in the crowd begin to feel its oppressive warmth.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, the gray clouds hang low, as if nature itself mourns the scene unfolding below. A raven caws from its perch atop the town's bell tower, its black form stark against the ashen sky. The church bells toll in slow, deliberate cadence, each strike a grim punctuation to the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the flames consume the pyre, the crowd remains rooted, some transfixed by the spectacle, others quietly slipping away, their faces pale and drawn. The square, once a place of gatherings and life, is now a stage for death, its air heavy with smoke, ash, and the lingering cries of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an emerald door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is an emerald fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[46] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[47] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see an emerald door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] w&#x000A;(first opening the gray door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the gray door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dim, oppressive chamber carved deep into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and coated in a thin layer of grime. The air is heavy with the stench of sweat, blood, and mildew, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusty iron sconces. Shadows dance on the walls, creating grotesque shapes that seem almost alive in the unsteady light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from the walls and ceilings, their metallic clinking faintly audible as prisoners shift or shudder in their restraints. The room is filled with the soft, pitiful moans of the tormented, their cries occasionally rising to sharp, desperate screams that echo through the corridors beyond. The sound of dripping water from a cracked stone ceiling adds an eerie rhythm to the unsettling cacophony.&#x000A;&#x000A;Scattered throughout the dungeon are various instruments of pain and suffering, their designs brutal and unyielding. A rack sits in the center of the room, its wooden frame splintered from years of use. Nearby, a brazier glows a dull red, its coals smoldering beneath a collection of iron tools-branding irons, pincers, and knives, their edges darkened with dried blood. A spiked chair looms in the corner, its cruel design gleaming faintly in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Prisoners are scattered across the room, each trapped in their own nightmare. A man lies stretched on the rack, his face contorted in agony as the torturer methodically turns the wheel, the creaking of wood and rope echoing in the chamber. Another prisoner hangs limply from manacles affixed to the wall, their body bruised and battered, barely able to lift their head. A third, seated in the spiked chair, breathes in shallow gasps, their movements restricted by the cruel embrace of the iron seat.&#x000A;&#x000A;The torturer moves about the chamber with practiced efficiency, their face obscured by a hood, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, their movements methodical and devoid of emotion, as if the suffering around them were merely a task to be completed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above it all, the dungeon's ceiling is low and oppressive, the occasional scuttling of rats in the shadows serving as a reminder of the filth and decay that permeates the space. The only exit-a heavy, iron-bound door reinforced with rivets-seems more a barrier to hope than a passage to freedom, its small viewing slit barred and shadowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a place of despair and cruelty, where the line between life and death is blurred, and the only certainty is the inevitability of suffering.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] l under seat&#x000A;You find the gray fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[51] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see a gray door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[53] w&#x000A;(first opening the indigo door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the indigo door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square is a charged space, bustling with a crowd eager to witness the grim spectacle.

At the center of the square stands a raised wooden platform, stark and imposing, where the grim sentence is to be carried out.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, their posture slumped under the weight of their fate. Their hands are bound tightly behind their back with coarse ropes, and their head hangs low, avoiding the stares of the gathered crowd. Their clothing, once fine, is now tattered and muddied, a visible testament to the fall from grace that has led to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd presses closer, encircling the platform with a mix of emotions etched onto their faces. Some jeer, shouting curses and insults, their voices rising in a cacophony of condemnation. Others watch in heavy silence, their expressions grim and reflective. A few hold children on their shoulders, their young faces filled with curious fascination, unaware of the gravity of what they are about to witness.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the platform, a town crier stands with a long scroll in hand, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd:"This man has been found guilty of high treason against the crown. Let his punishment serve as a warning to all who would seek to defy the will of the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches at the words but remains silent, their face pale and eyes darting nervously. The executioner, a large figure clad in a hooded black robe, stands nearby with arms crossed, their demeanor cold and methodical. A few feet away, the guillotine looms, its blade gleaming dully in the filtered light, ready to deliver the final judgment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The tension in the square is palpable as the crier steps aside and the executioner signals for the crowd to quiet. The murmurs fade, replaced by an oppressive silence that hangs over the scene like a shroud. The only sounds now are the rustle of the wind and the faint creak of the wooden scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned is led toward the guillotine, a crow caws from a nearby rooftop, its harsh cry echoing through the square like a dark omen. The crowd leans forward, holding its collective breath, as the weight of justice and mortality descends upon the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an indigo door and a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[54] l under platform&#x000A;You find the indigo fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[55] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see an indigo door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[57] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a chaotic yet oddly functional space, tucked away from the flashing lights and lively crowds. Its walls are made of corrugated metal or weathered wood, with patches of rust and peeling paint revealing the room's age. The faint smell of grease, dust, and damp canvas hangs in the air, mingled with a hint of stale popcorn and cotton candy from the midway outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves line the walls, crammed with a mishmash of supplies. Boxes of lightbulbs, spools of electrical wiring, and stacks of replacement parts for rides and games are piled haphazardly, some labeled in fading marker, others left to mystery. A collection of brightly colored pennant flags and strings of carnival lights dangles from hooks, their wires tangled into an unruly knot.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a pile of folded canvas tarps and tent poles leans precariously against the wall, ready to be deployed for setting up new attractions or repairing existing ones. Nearby, over sized crates are labeled with blocky stencils: "GAME PRIZES", RIDE PARTS", and "SPARE SIGNAGE". One crate is open, revealing a jumble of stuffed animals, rubber balls, and plastic toys meant to delight lucky winners.&#x000A;&#x000A;The center of the room is dominated by larger items-spare seats for rides, unassembled game booths, and the occasional disassembled attraction part, like a faded carousel horse or a section of a Ferris wheel's gondola. These are covered in tarps or wrapped in protective blankets, their surfaces scratched and worn from transport and use.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small, battered desk sits near the entrance, cluttered with maintenance logs, mismatched tools, and a few empty coffee cups. Above it, a cork board displays a chaotic array of pinned notes: ride schedules, repair requests, and a map of the carnival grounds with certain areas circled in red. A single fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting uneven shadows across the room and giving it a slightly eerie feel.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of concrete and dirt, strewn with stray bolts, screws, and scraps of paper. In the darker corners, the scuttling of a rat or the glint of a spider's web serves as a reminder that this space, while essential, is far from pristine.&#x000A;&#x000A;The carnival storage room is not glamorous, but it is vital-a hidden world of spare parts, forgotten treasures, and organized chaos that keeps the carnival running smoothly. It's a backstage glimpse into the hard work and improvisation that make the magic possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[58] w&#x000A;(first opening the khaki door)&#x000A;(first unlocking the khaki door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is as unsettling as the ride itself, designed to leave riders with a lingering sense of unease. The pathway emerges from a dark, narrow corridor, its walls painted in peeling black with streaks of red that resemble dripping blood. Dim, flickering lights cast erratic shadows across the uneven floor, creating an oppressive atmosphere that follows riders even after they've left the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;The air is cooler here, with a faint metallic tang and the unmistakable scent of dampness, as though the exit leads not back to the carnival but somewhere deeper underground. Sound effects of faint whispers and distant screams play softly in the background, barely audible over the creak of the exit door swinging open and the occasional burst of laughter or screams from the ride's next passengers.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step out into a small courtyard, enclosed by jagged, rusted metal fencing adorned with fake cobwebs and plastic bones. A weathered sign swings overhead, painted in bold, Gothic letters: "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now."&#x000A;&#x000A;Nearby, a few carnival workers in tattered costumes linger, their expressions disturbingly neutral as they watch riders leave. One might mumble cryptic phrases like, "Not everyone makes it out&#x2026;" before breaking into a crooked grin.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit path leads past a small merchandise stand selling ride-themed merchandise-"Hell Ride Survivor" t-shirts, devil horns, and glow-in-the-dark trinkets shaped like skulls. The stand is bathed in red light, adding to the ominous mood.&#x000A;&#x000A;Just beyond the fencing, the cheerful sounds and colorful lights of the carnival midway feel jarringly out of place, a sharp contrast to the oppressive darkness of the ride. Riders often pause to gather themselves, exchanging nervous laughter or adjusting their belongings, before stepping back into the lively world of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Hell Ride exit leaves riders not just thrilled, but marked by the eerie experience, a reminder of the fine line between fun and fear that defines the carnival's darkest attraction.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[59] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand is a khaki fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[60] get khaki fuse from merchandise stand&#x000A;You find nothing!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[61] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;You can see a khaki door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[62] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[63] test b3&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[64] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[65] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[66] put aqua in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[67] push switch&#x000A;The indicator light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[68] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[69] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;You are in a section of the electrical room.

It's where the real work happens-a nerve center for monitoring and managing the operations of the rides, attractions, and lighting systems. The room is enclosed by plain, industrial walls, painted a dull gray and marked with scuffs, scratches, and the occasional smudge of grease or fingerprints.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rows of monitors line the main wall, displaying live feeds from security cameras and ride controls. Each screen shows a different part of the carnival: blinking lights of the Ferris wheel, the whirling motion of a carousel, and the eerie darkness of the Hell Ride. A few screens flicker or show static, adding to the sense of wear and tear that pervades the room. Beneath the monitors, a control panel is cluttered with switches, buttons, and dials, each labeled with functions like "Ride Start," "Lighting Override", and "Emergency Stop." Small lights blink in green, yellow, or red, signaling the status of different systems.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hum of electronics fills the air, mingled with the occasional crackle of a two-way radio resting on a desk. The radios buzz intermittently with the voices of carnival workers reporting issues or coordinating movements: "Maintenance to Tilt-a-Whirl-need a wrench at Station 2!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor is a patchwork of worn linoleum and exposed concrete, littered with stray papers, toolkits, and empty coffee cups. A cluttered desk sits against one wall, covered with logbooks, ride schedules, and laminated emergency procedures. A corkboard above the desk is pinned with maintenance charts, carnival maps, and handwritten notes, some of them circled in red ink with messages like "Check circuit breakers on Zipper" or "Replace bulbs near south entrance."&#x000A;&#x000A;A single fluorescent light fixture hangs overhead, buzzing faintly as it casts a cold, sterile glow across the room. The air is cool but tinged with a faint metallic smell, mixed with the earthy dampness from the surrounding carnival grounds. In one corner, a small, battered first-aid kit hangs on the wall, its contents slightly spilling out, and a faded fire extinguisher sits nearby.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite its unassuming appearance, the control room feels alive with purpose-a behind-the-scenes hub that ensures the carnival's magic unfolds without a hitch. It's a space where the mechanics, electronics, and human effort merge to keep the carnival running smoothly, even as chaos and excitement reign outside.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Control Panel here.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[110] l at control panel&#x000A;The control panel is populated with a row of colored lights.
