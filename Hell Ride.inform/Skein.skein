You can see the treats inside the stand.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a menu, a can of Cola, a bucket of popcorn, a candy apple, cotton candy, and a soft pretzel here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>

In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Hell Ride - A Ride to remember...&#x000A;&#x000A;In the early 1980's, I had an Apple II Plus computer with 64K of RAM, dual 5.25" floppy disks, and a color monitor as big as a television. And the very first game I ever bought was Infocom's Zork I: The Great Underground Empire. This was cool. It was all text-based. The game described your surroundings and you interacted with commands that say what you wanted to do. This "Interactive Fiction" really evoked in a game what I appreciated most about reading: rich descriptions, colorful characters, and the like. After Zork I, there was Zork II and III. Enchanter, Moonmist, Suspect, and so many more. I played them all with my best friend Andy.&#x000A;&#x000A;Andy and I were software developers at the time and we thought, "We can do this!" So we set out to do this. We developed a game engine with a natural language parser. And it was pretty good. We could support most of the kinds of things they did, certainly less graceful but pretty good. In fact, our parser was better than theirs in a case where the sentence was ambiguous. e.g. "Walk into the room with the lamp." Is the player carrying the lamp? Or is the lamp in the room?&#x000A;&#x000A;For fun, we reverse engineered parts of Infocom's game format. We found the dictionary, certain text tokens used for text substitution, the game text. We also discovered the first example of compression I had ever seen and it just about made my head explode. They stored all ASCII characters in five bits! Pow! Mind blown. I had never considered anything like that. Just another hook.&#x000A;&#x000A;We developed two prototypes: Diner and Hell Ride.

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">Hell Ride - A Ride to remember...&#x000A;&#x000A;In the early 1980's, I had an Apple II Plus computer with 64K of RAM, dual 5.25" floppy disks, and a color monitor as big as a television. And the very first game I ever bought was Infocom's Zork I: The Great Underground Empire. This was cool. It was all text-based. The game described your surroundings and you interacted with commands that say what you wanted to do. This "Interactive Fiction" really evoked in a game what I appreciated most about reading: rich descriptions, colorful characters, and the like. After Zork I, there was Zork II and III. Enchanter, Moonmist, Suspect, and so many more. I played them all with my best friend Andy.&#x000A;&#x000A;Andy and I were software developers at the time and we thought, "We can do this!" So we set out to do this. We developed a game engine with a natural language parser. And it was pretty good. We could support most of the kinds of things they did, certainly less graceful but pretty good. In fact, our parser was better than theirs in a case where the sentence was ambiguous. e.g. "Walk into the room with the lamp." Is the player carrying the lamp? Or is the lamp in the room?&#x000A;&#x000A;For fun, we reverse engineered parts of Infocom's game format. We found the dictionary, certain text tokens used for text substitution, the game text. We also discovered the first example of compression I had ever seen and it just about made my head explode. They stored all ASCII characters in five bits! Pow! Mind blown. I had never considered anything like that. Just another hook.&#x000A;&#x000A;We developed two prototypes: Diner and Hell Ride. Diner was about bank robbers coming into the diner where you are a short order cook and you have to save the day. Hell Ride was pretty close to what you find here. I decided to implement it using modern tools. It's pretty good.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hope you enjoy it.&#x000A;&#x000A;d.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Please press SPACE to continue.</commentary>

A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Exotic!" A rotund barker, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him that says "Dime Admission."  The Ticket Kiosk is back the way you came.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers. Perhaps there's a fortune teller inside, offering cryptic clues about your journey or a hidden artifact that can be collected. There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up, pay for, and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.The barker cries:&#x000A;&#x000A;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round! &#x000A;Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! &#x000A;She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. &#x000A;Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids-a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and exotic allure! &#x000A;For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] give dime to barker&#x000A;You hand over a dime, and the barker nods, waving you through. As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now-one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction's facade is to the east.

Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance.

As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. During her performance she balances a sword on her head and accents her dance with finger cymbals.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[36] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The music alternates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, creating an emotional arc that keeps you entranced.

The dancer takes a bow to enthusiastic applause, leaving you spellbound by the sensual yet artful display.&#x000A;&#x000A;You applaud until your hands are sore. Did she just wink at me?&#x000A;&#x000A;As she leaves the stage, Little Egypt tosses one of her veils to you!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] get lamp&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] turn it on&#x000A;You flip a switch.

At the center is a sturdy metal pole, with a large bell hanging at the top, signaling when a successful attempt has been made. Along the length of the pole are markings indicating how strong you are.  A nearby sign says, "Buy a mallet, strike the bell, win a prize."&#x000A;&#x000A;Spectators gather around, cheering on participants and offering lighthearted jabs and encouragement, creating a lively, competitive atmosphere.

The wheel's massive steel frame arches high into the sky, its intricate network of beams glinting under the colorful glow of bulbs strung along its circumference. Each gondola, painted in bright hues like red, yellow, and blue, dangles from the wheel, swaying gently as it turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;At night, the Ferris wheel transforms into a dazzling spectacle, with hundreds of synchronized lights creating patterns and ripples that pulse outward like waves.

The circular platform is adorned with a canopy of swirling colors, gold trim, and decorative mirrors that reflect the flickering bulbs lining its edges.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rows of hand-carved animals, most often horses with flowing manes, are arranged in a circle. Each is painted in vivid colors, detailed with golden saddles and ribbons. Some carousels also feature exotic creatures like lions, tigers, or sea dragons, adding whimsy to the ride. The animals rise and fall gently as the carousel spins, mimicking a galloping motion.&#x000A;&#x000A;The carousel's warm, playful tunes drift across the midway, inviting riders of all ages to enjoy its simple delight.

The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read "HELL RIDE", pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crooked sign warns, "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!" Nearby, a carnival barker with a theatrical, raspy voice calls out, "Step right up! The gates of hell are open-will you brave the darkness?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes. Beyond the threshold lies only uncertainty and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[112] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[113] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is a cobblestone expanse bordered by weathered timber-framed buildings. The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty-a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[114] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. Beside him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air-a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[115] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[116] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors-one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[117] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 25 out of a possible 100, in 99 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show.

Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance.

She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically.

The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read "HELL RIDE", pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crooked sign warns, "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!" Nearby, a carnival barker with a theatrical, raspy voice calls out, "Step right up! The gates of hell are open-will you brave the darkness?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes. Beyond the threshold lies only uncertainty and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[112] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[113] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is a cobblestone expanse bordered by weathered timber-framed buildings. The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty-a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[114] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. Beside him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air-a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[115] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[116] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors-one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[117] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 25 out of a possible 100, in 99 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>

A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Exotic!" A rotund barker, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him that says "Dime Admission."  The Ticket Kiosk is back the way you came.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are standing in front of a dark and mysterious tent filled with illusions and exotic performers. Perhaps there's a fortune teller inside, offering cryptic clues about your journey or a hidden artifact that can be collected. There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up, pay for, and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.The barker cries:&#x000A;&#x000A;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round! &#x000A;Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! &#x000A;She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. &#x000A;Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids-a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and exotic allure! &#x000A;For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Barker here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] give dime to barker&#x000A;You hand over a dime, and the barker nods, waving you through. As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now-one filled with the scents of incense and exotic spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] w&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Show Tent&#x000A;You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction's facade is to the east. There are folding chairs organized neatly in rows.

Scents of incense waft through the air, enhancing the atmosphere of mystique. The backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures to evoking a sense of being transported to the "Middle East". &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt emerges draped in flowing silk veils which she skillfully uses as part of the dance. Her attire consists of a sparkling, sequined bodice and a flowing skirt, adorned with jingling coin belts and jewelry that accentuate her movements.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[34] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing you into the rhythm of exotic live music played on traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. During her performance she balances a sword on her head and accents her dance with finger cymbals.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[36] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The music alternates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, creating an emotional arc that keeps you entranced. Little Egypt relies on the music's dynamic changes to tell a story with movements reflecting joy, sorrow, seduction, and celebration.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The performance concludes with a dramatic flourish of a fast-paced shimmy, a bold spin, and Little Egypt dramatically casts off her veils. The dancer takes a bow to enthusiastic applause, leaving you spellbound by the sensual yet artful display.&#x000A;&#x000A;You applaud until your hands are sore. Did she just wink at me?&#x000A;&#x000A;As she leaves the stage, Little Egypt tosses one of her veils to you!&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] get lamp&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] turn it on&#x000A;You flip a switch.

At the center is a sturdy metal pole, with a large bell hanging at the top, signaling when a successful attempt has been made.

Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Peace Train" by Cat Stevens can be heard playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[120] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems," and "Emergency Shutdown." Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts-fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Over the loud speaker, an announcment blares: Attention please. There is a vehicle being towed from the parking lot for parking illegally. The license plate of the car is "862901". You breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that's not your license plate. I guess it's a good thing you remembered to place the parking stub on the dashboard.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[121] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel lock, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[122] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel lock: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[123] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the operational core of the carnival ride, a bustling, noisy space dominated by a massive motor. Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cluttered workbench holds tools and spare parts-wrenches, bolts, and lubricants-alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[124] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A; The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.&#x000A;&#x000A;The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts-filters, spark plugs, and wire coils-while tools lie scattered on a workbench beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety poster that warns, "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[125] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.&#x000A;&#x000A;In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.&#x000A;&#x000A;The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic-a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment. This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous! There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[126] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet One.

The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray-rusty wrenches, screws, and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls display faded safety posters, a corkboard with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose-a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a coffee mug.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a ladder and aqua colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Eagles' "Hotel California" is now playing.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[137] test b2&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[138] w&#x000A;(first opening aqua colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking aqua colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stocks Room&#x000A;The public square is a cobblestone expanse bordered by weathered timber-framed buildings. The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty-a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see aqua colored door and a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[139] l under stocks&#x000A;You find aqua colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[140] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a coffee mug.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see aqua colored door and a ladder here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[141] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The DJ just cued up Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[142] w&#x000A;(first opening crimson colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking crimson colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. Beside him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air-a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[143] l under platform&#x000A;You find crimson colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[144] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[145] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[146] w&#x000A;(first opening emerald colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking emerald colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[147] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is emerald colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[148] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[149] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[150] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[151] w&#x000A;(first opening gray colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking gray colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors-one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[152] l under seat&#x000A;You find gray colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[153] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[154] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[155] w&#x000A;(first opening indigo colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking indigo colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door and a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[156] l under platform&#x000A;You find indigo colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[157] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[158] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[159] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a cramped yet essential space, tucked away from the bustling grounds. Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves overflow with supplies-boxes of lightbulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts-piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with maintenance logs, tools, and empty coffee cups. Above it, a corkboard brims with ride schedules, repair requests, and notes. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with bolts, screws, and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[160] w&#x000A;(first opening khaki colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking khaki colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease.

The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, "Not everyone makes it out."&#x000A;&#x000A;A merchandise stand glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor shirts and devil horns.

The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray-rusty wrenches, screws, and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls display faded safety posters, a corkboard with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose-a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[115] turn on radio&#x000A;You flip a switch.

The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Peace Train" by Cat Stevens can be heard playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[120] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems," and "Emergency Shutdown." Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts-fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Over the loud speaker, an announcment blares: Attention please. There is a vehicle being towed from the parking lot for parking illegally. The license plate of the car is "862901". You breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that's not your license plate. I guess it's a good thing you remembered to place the parking stub on the dashboard.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[121] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel lock, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[122] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel lock: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[123] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the operational core of the carnival ride, a bustling, noisy space dominated by a massive motor. Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cluttered workbench holds tools and spare parts-wrenches, bolts, and lubricants-alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[124] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A; The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.&#x000A;&#x000A;The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts-filters, spark plugs, and wire coils-while tools lie scattered on a workbench beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety poster that warns, "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[125] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.&#x000A;&#x000A;In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.&#x000A;&#x000A;The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic-a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment. This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous! There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[126] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet One.

The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty-a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below.

At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. Beside him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air-a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[143] l under platform&#x000A;You find crimson colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[144] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[145] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[146] w&#x000A;(first opening emerald colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking emerald colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[147] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is emerald colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[148] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[149] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[150] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[151] w&#x000A;(first opening gray colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking gray colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors-one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[152] l under seat&#x000A;You find gray colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[153] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[154] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[155] w&#x000A;(first opening indigo colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking indigo colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door and a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[156] l under platform&#x000A;You find indigo colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[157] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[158] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[159] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a cramped yet essential space, tucked away from the bustling grounds. Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves overflow with supplies-boxes of lightbulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts-piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with maintenance logs, tools, and empty coffee cups. Above it, a corkboard brims with ride schedules, repair requests, and notes. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with bolts, screws, and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[160] w&#x000A;(first opening khaki colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking khaki colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease.

The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones.

Twinkling lights outline its edges, blinking rhythmically to draw attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single window serves visitors, where a smiling attendant dispenses colorful tickets from neatly arranged rolls. Beside the tickets, a cash drawer jingles as change is counted, and a digital payment system glows faintly for modern convenience. Too bad you don't have a debit card.&#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides and treats. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and fried dough wafts from nearby stalls.&#x000A;&#x000A;The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers. Families, couples, and friends form a buzzing line, their excitement building as they approach this first step into the magic of the carnival.&#x000A;&#x000A;The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. The prices of ride tickets are on the signboard.

The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read "HELL RIDE", pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crooked sign warns, "One Ticket Admission: Enter If You Dare!" Nearby, a carnival barker with a theatrical, raspy voice calls out, "Step right up! The gates of hell are open-will you brave the darkness?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes. Beyond the threshold lies only uncertainty and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The doors open and your car passes through into the darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stocks&#x000A;The public square is a cobblestone expanse bordered by weathered timber-framed buildings. The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty-a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gallows&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. Beside him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air-a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Stake&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors-one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;Mist fills the area as you move to the next room.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Guillotine&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 10 out of a possible 100, in 30 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looks like your goose is cooked. Say "Goodnight, Gracie!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stupefied as you sit watching guillotine rising and falling, dropping like a stone on the cars in front of you. Thank goodness they are empty. As your turn comes, you raise your hands in a feeble attempt to stop the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 10 out of a possible 100, in 30 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</commentary>

A strong, narrow beam of light shines from the flashlight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] s&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The maintenance office, hidden behind the carnival's bright facade, is a dim and cluttered space reeking of grease, sweat, and faint traces of popcorn from the midway. The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray-rusty wrenches, screws, and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls display faded safety posters, a corkboard with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose-a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] turn on radio&#x000A;You flip a switch. Through the static, you pick up hear bits of the latest Taylor Swift song.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] l at desk&#x000A;It's a desk. There are coffee stains and cigarette burns from years of abuse. The single drawer is shut.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk are a coffee mug and a radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;The DJ just cued up Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[51] open drawer&#x000A;You open the drawer, revealing a scissors, a stapler, a ballpoint pen, and a pad of paper.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] get all from the drawer&#x000A;scissors: Taken.&#x000A;stapler: Taken.&#x000A;ballpoint pen: Taken.&#x000A;pad of paper: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash is on the air.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[53] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;The crawl space beneath the carnival ride is a tight, claustrophobic tunnel shrouded in darkness and filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Peace Train" by Cat Stevens can be heard playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[54] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems," and "Emergency Shutdown." Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts-fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[55] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel lock, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel lock: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[57] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the operational core of the carnival ride, a bustling, noisy space dominated by a massive motor. Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cluttered workbench holds tools and spare parts-wrenches, bolts, and lubricants-alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[58] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A; The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.&#x000A;&#x000A;The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts-filters, spark plugs, and wire coils-while tools lie scattered on a workbench beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety poster that warns, "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[59] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.&#x000A;&#x000A;In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.&#x000A;&#x000A;The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic-a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment. This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous! There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[60] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet One.

The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty-a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see aqua colored door and a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[73] l under stocks&#x000A;You find aqua colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[74] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a coffee mug.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see aqua colored door and a ladder here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[75] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The DJ just cued up Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[76] w&#x000A;(first opening crimson colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking crimson colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. Beside him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air-a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[77] l under platform&#x000A;You find crimson colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[78] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[79] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[80] w&#x000A;(first opening emerald colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking emerald colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[81] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is emerald colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[82] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[85] w&#x000A;(first opening gray colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking gray colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors-one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[86] l under seat&#x000A;You find gray colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[87] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[88] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[89] w&#x000A;(first opening indigo colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking indigo colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism.

Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves overflow with supplies-boxes of lightbulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts-piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with maintenance logs, tools, and empty coffee cups. Above it, a corkboard brims with ride schedules, repair requests, and notes. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with bolts, screws, and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[94] w&#x000A;(first opening khaki colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking khaki colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease. Emerging from a dark corridor with peeling black and red-streaked walls, flickering lights cast erratic shadows on the uneven floor. The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, "Not everyone makes it out."&#x000A;&#x000A;A merchandise stand glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor shirts and devil horns. Beyond the fencing, the cheerful carnival lights and sounds feel jarring, contrasting sharply with the ride's oppressive atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience-it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[95] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand is khaki colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[96] get khaki fuse from merchandise stand&#x000A;You find nothing!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[97] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[98] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[99] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[100] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[101] put aqua in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the aqua fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[102] push switch&#x000A;The indicator light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[103] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[104] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet Three.

At the center is a sturdy metal pole, with a large bell hanging at the top, signaling when a successful attempt has been made.

A nearby sign says, "Buy a mallet, strike the bell, win a prize."&#x000A;&#x000A;Spectators gather around, cheering on participants and offering lighthearted jabs and encouragement, creating a lively, competitive atmosphere.

The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray-rusty wrenches, screws, and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls display faded safety posters, a corkboard with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose-a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] turn on radio&#x000A;You flip a switch.

The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space-the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes and cables crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Peace Train" by Cat Stevens can be heard playing on the radio.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[54] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls," "Brake Systems," and "Emergency Shutdown." Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.&#x000A;&#x000A;A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts-fuses, cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[55] open toolbox&#x000A;You open the toolbox, revealing a monkey wrench, a channel lock, pliers, and a hammer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] get all from toolbox&#x000A;monkey wrench: Taken.&#x000A;channel lock: Taken.&#x000A;pliers: Taken.&#x000A;hammer: Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[57] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;The south mechanical room is the operational core of the carnival ride, a bustling, noisy space dominated by a massive motor. Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.&#x000A;&#x000A;Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cluttered workbench holds tools and spare parts-wrenches, bolts, and lubricants-alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.&#x000A;&#x000A;A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[58] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A; The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.&#x000A;&#x000A;The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts-filters, spark plugs, and wire coils-while tools lie scattered on a workbench beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.&#x000A;&#x000A;A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety poster that warns, "Fuel Safely-No Open Flames!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[59] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.&#x000A;&#x000A;A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.&#x000A;&#x000A;In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.&#x000A;&#x000A;The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic-a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment. This room is oozing with electromagnetic energy. You can feel your hair stand on end and all your nerves twitching. This feels dangerous! There are exits in all directions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[60] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet One.

The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray-rusty wrenches, screws, and mismatched containers with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.&#x000A;&#x000A;The walls display faded safety posters, a corkboard with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose-a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a coffee mug.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a ladder and aqua colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Eagles' "Hotel California" is now playing.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] test b2&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[72] w&#x000A;(first opening aqua colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking aqua colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stocks Room&#x000A;The public square is a cobblestone expanse bordered by weathered timber-framed buildings. The air carries the mingling scents of chimney smoke, damp earth, and the faint tang of a nearby smithy. At its center, crude wooden stocks stand as a grim focal point, their beams weathered and stained from years of use. Iron clasps lock captives in degrading postures, their tattered clothing offering little protection from the biting wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;The punished individuals hang their heads in shame, their faces etched with despair. Around them, the crowd revels in cruelty-a wiry man spits insults with gleeful laughter, while a stout woman throws overripe vegetables, each impact sparking jeers. Even children join in, pointing and mocking with mischievous delight.&#x000A;&#x000A;The square hums with noise: the crowd's taunts, the crack of objects hitting wood, and the quiet murmurs of the suffering captives. Overhead, a gray sky threatens rain, indifferent to the spectacle below. The jeering mob ignores its ominous weight, too engrossed in their shared cruelty to notice nature's disapproval.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see aqua colored door and a wooden stocks here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[73] l under stocks&#x000A;You find aqua colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[74] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Maintenance Office&#x000A;The radio burbles on.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the desk is a coffee mug.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see aqua colored door and a ladder here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The radio plays "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[75] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The DJ just cued up Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[76] w&#x000A;(first opening crimson colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking crimson colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Gallows Room&#x000A;The public square, slick with morning drizzle, lies under a brooding, overcast sky. At its center looms the gallows, a weathered wooden platform with thick ropes swaying ominously. The crowd stands in somber silence, broken by the shuffle of feet or faint murmurs, their eyes fixed on the grim scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;A hooded executioner, cloaked in black, adjusts the frayed noose with practiced precision, his cold presence exuding purpose. Beside him stands the condemned man, pale and trembling, his bound hands behind him. Beads of sweat mix with rain on his haunted face as his darting eyes search the indifferent crowd. Each shallow breath forms a fleeting cloud in the chilly air-a fragile reminder of his fleeting life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Vendors hawk bread and cider, while children strain for a better view. An old man clutches a rosary, whispering prayers, as others smirk and place bets. Above, the bell tower tolls, its mournful chime marking the passage of the man's final moments. A raven perches on the gallows" beam, its unblinking gaze fixed on the scene below.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the executioner adjusts the noose around the man's neck, the crowd falls silent, the air thick with dread. Distant thunder rumbles faintly, as if the heavens themselves await the inevitable.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door and a gallows platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[77] l under platform&#x000A;You find crimson colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[78] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Crawl Space&#x000A;You can see crimson colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pharell's "Happy" is playing now.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[79] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[80] w&#x000A;(first opening emerald colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking emerald colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Stake Room&#x000A;The public square is steeped in grim silence, broken only by the crackling of flames. At its center, three wooden stakes rise from a pyre of logs and kindling, darkened by smoke from past executions. Bound to the stakes are three women, their faces reflecting defiance, resignation, and terror.&#x000A;&#x000A;A crowd encircles the scene, expressions ranging from morbid fascination to righteous fury. Children cling to their mothers, while elders nod solemnly. Some jeer and throw stones; others murmur prayers or avert their gaze.&#x000A;&#x000A;The executioner, hooded and clad in a leather apron, steps forward with a blazing torch, igniting the pyre in a sudden roar. Flames climb rapidly as thick smoke coils upward. The condemned cry out, their voices mingling with the crackle of fire. The oppressive heat radiates outward, pressing against the silent, uneasy crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gray clouds loom overhead, nature's somber backdrop to the grim spectacle. A raven caws from the bell tower as slow church bells toll, each strike punctuating the tragedy. As the pyre burns, some onlookers remain transfixed while others quietly slip away, the square heavy with ash, smoke, and the echoes of the condemned.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[81] l in pyre&#x000A;In the pyre is emerald colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[82] get fuse from pyre&#x000A;You find the pyre!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room North&#x000A;You can see emerald colored door and a toolbox (empty) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[85] w&#x000A;(first opening gray colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking gray colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Dungeon&#x000A;The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors-one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. The sole exit, a riveted iron-bound door, feels more like a barrier to hope than a path to freedom.&#x000A;&#x000A;This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[86] l under seat&#x000A;You find gray colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[87] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Mechanical Room South&#x000A;You can see gray colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[88] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[89] w&#x000A;(first opening indigo colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking indigo colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Guillotine Room&#x000A;The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.&#x000A;&#x000A;A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner-a hooded figure in black-stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.&#x000A;&#x000A;As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is just lone problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be decapitated.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door and a guillotine platform here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[90] l under platform&#x000A;You find indigo colored fuse!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[91] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Generator Room&#x000A;You can see indigo colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[92] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[93] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;The carnival storage room is a cramped yet essential space, tucked away from the bustling grounds. Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Shelves overflow with supplies-boxes of lightbulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts-piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.&#x000A;&#x000A;The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with maintenance logs, tools, and empty coffee cups. Above it, a corkboard brims with ride schedules, repair requests, and notes. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with bolts, screws, and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[94] w&#x000A;(first opening khaki colored door)&#x000A;(first unlocking khaki colored door)&#x000A;(with the silver key)&#x000A;&#x000A;Ride Exit&#x000A;The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease. Emerging from a dark corridor with peeling black and red-streaked walls, flickering lights cast erratic shadows on the uneven floor. The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.&#x000A;&#x000A;Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic bones. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, "You've Survived&#x2026; For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, "Not everyone makes it out."&#x000A;&#x000A;A merchandise stand glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor shirts and devil horns. Beyond the fencing, the cheerful carnival lights and sounds feel jarring, contrasting sharply with the ride's oppressive atmosphere.&#x000A;&#x000A;The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience-it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[95] l in stand&#x000A;In the merchandise stand is khaki colored fuse.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[96] get khaki fuse from merchandise stand&#x000A;You find nothing!&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[97] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Storage Room&#x000A;You can see khaki colored door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[98] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[99] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet One&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[100] open panel&#x000A;That's already open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[101] put aqua in socket&#x000A;You hear a satisfying snick as the aqua fuse slides into place.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[102] push switch&#x000A;The indicator light goes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone up by five points.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[103] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Room&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[104] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Electrical Closet Three&#x000A;This is Electrical Closet Three.
