Parking Lot
The lot stretches across an open field, gravel crunching under the tires of arriving cars. Floodlights and the carnival's colorful glow light the area, accompanied by distant laughter, music, and the hum of rides.

Cars park haphazardly, guided by makeshift signs and fluttering flags. Families and visitors mingle, some lingering in vehicles, preparing for the chilly evening ahead. Shadows from encroaching trees are pierced by the occasional flash of a flashlight. At the entrance, an attendant collects fees in a weathered booth, making change from a cash box.

Puddles from recent rain shimmer under the lights, while patches of mud cling to shoes. In the distance, RVs and trailers sit quietly, their occupants watching the Ferris wheel turn against the evening sky. The lot serves as a transition between the mundane and the magical world inside the carnival.

The midway is to the south. There is a blueberry bush here. There are blueberries on the bush.

Your car is here. It's a bit of a beater. Inside the car, you can see the glove box, the seat, the rear view mirror, the ignition, and the dashboard.

You can see a parking attendant here.

The attendant has a parking ticket. The price of a parking ticket is $5.00.

Ticket Booth
Painted in bright red and yellow stripes, the ticket kiosk stands at the entrance with flickering lights to draw attention. A smiling cashier hands out tickets, while the cash drawer jingles. A digital payment system sits in the corner. Too bad you don't have a debit card.

To the right, a signboard displays ticket prices alongside illustrations of the rides. Pennant flags flutter and the air is filled with the scent of popcorn, pretzels, and grease.

The ground is worn from the steps of carnival goers eagerly waiting in line as they approach the midway.

The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. A price list for attraction tickets is on the signboard. The cashier has Hell Ride ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.

Carousel
The carousel radiates charm with its brightly painted horses, lights, and calliope music. The platform features a canopy of colors and decorative mirrors. Hand-carved animals, including horses, lions, tigers, and sea dragons, circle as the carousel spins. The animals rise and fall gently, adding to the charm. The music rises from the Carousel inviting riders of all ages to enjoy this most basic symbol of the carnival.

Gripping the pole, you settle into the saddle as the carousel begins to spin.

As it speeds up, the world blurs in a swirl of colors, and the gentle rise and fall mimics a playful gallop. Laughter mixes with the music, creating a nostalgic atmosphere.

Concession Stand
The concession stand is a destination for many along the midway. Twinkling lights frame the stand making it glow amid the carnival's buzz.

Behind the counter, popcorn churns in the machine, candy apples gleam, and cotton candy spins in clouds. Warm pretzels sit under a heat lamp, while sodas chill in a frosted cooler. The counter is cluttered with bags, napkins, and sprinkle cups. Kids tug at parents, teens share pretzels, and the crowd buzzes with energy.

There is a menu to the right of the window. You can see the treats inside the stand. There are exits to the south and northeast.

Nearby a sturdy door leads south.

"Hell Ride is a finicky ride. I'm fixing something there every week. Last week, Mr. Whidbey asked me to skip Hell Ride's maintenance slot. There was a real fire in the Stakes Room last month. And just yesterday I caught him creeping around the guillotine room" says the janitor.

>ask janitor about ferris wheel
The janitor looks at you expectantly.

The janitor remarks, "The other day, I found a bolt on one of the gondolas so loose it had almost come off. That would have been a tragedy!"

>ask janitor about bumper cars

The janitor says "Funny thing about that. The fuses that belong in the electrical panels in the electrical area of backstage seem to be missing. Finding them might help with disabling Hell Ride."

>ask janitor about fire
The janitor looks bored as he waits for you to speak.

"The very real fire in the Stakes Room in Hell Ride was a scary event. I couldn't put it out with a fire extinguisher. We had to wait for the fire department and by then there was a lot of damage done" says the janitor.

>ask janitor about accidents
The janitor looks at you and waits for you to proceed.

The janitor says "The fire, the Ferris wheel, the Bumper Cars... That's a lot of suspicious accidents."

>ask janitor about rides

Bumper Cars
The bumper cars are a lively scene of flashing lights and vibrant decorations. The arena is surrounded by padded barriers, ensuring the rider's safety. Cars in faded reds, blues, yellows, and greens glide across the slick floor, each equipped with a steering wheel and padded bumper. Riders maneuver their cars with intensity, creating a din of bumps and laughter. Overhead, electric poles hum with energy. While onlookers cheer from the sidelines, the bumper cars offer playful competition and nostalgic fun for all. The Ticket Kiosk is southeast of here.

Fortune Teller
Approaching the fortune teller's booth, you are drawn in by its mysterious allure and inky softness. Draped in deep purple curtains adorned with golden moons and stars, the booth is lit only with the flickering of candles. The air is heavy with the scent of incense, mingling with and then overpowering the ever-present sugary odor of carnival treats. A sign sways slightly in the evening breeze.

Stepping inside, you're greeted by Esmeralda, a figure cloaked in flowing robes with a jeweled headpiece catching the flickering light. Her piercing eyes seem to look right through you as they gesture for you to sit at a small round table. At its center rests a glowing crystal ball, surrounded by tarot cards and mysterious trinkets.

Esmeralda's voice is low and melodic, weaving an air of intrigue as they ask you to focus on a question and offer you a tarot reading. The room seems to shrink, the bustling carnival outside fading into the background as she reveals your fate. Each card turned feels significant, as though unlocking a secret you didn't know you carried.

Past: The High Priestess (reversed)
High Priestess reversed indicates blocked psychic abilities, and little to no awareness of the subconscious influence on your reality. This reversal suggests a lack of trust in your inner voice and a disconnection from spiritual realms. It may indicate a struggle to access your intuition, leading to confusion and indecision. The reversed High Priestess also urges caution in matters of secrecy and deception. It is important to exercise discernment as there may be hidden agendas or deceitful individuals around. It is crucial for you to seek inner clarity now.

>z
Time passes.

Present: Six of Swords (upright)
Six of Swords brings a sense of calm and transition. As you embark on this journey, find solace in leaving behind turbulent waters and moving towards a more peaceful horizon. The image of the boat slowly gliding across the steady river symbolizes the passage from one phase of life to another, offering the opportunity to heal, reflect, and gather your strength. This card invites you to embrace the subtle winds of change and trust that better days lie ahead.

>z
Time passes.

Challenge: Queen of Swords (reversed)
Queen of Swords reversed exudes an air of manipulation, deception, and cruelty. Her once discerning and judicious nature has turned into a cold hearted determination to achieve her own agenda, regardless of the consequences. She wields her intellectual prowess as a weapon, using it to strip others of their power and inflict emotional harm. With her cutting words and dismissive actions, she creates an atmosphere of hostility and mistrust. The Queen of Swords Reversed serves as a reminder to be cautious of those who may mask their malicious intentions with intelligence and charm.

>z
Time passes.

Opportunity: Two of Swords (upright)
Two of Swords encourages you to remove the blindfold and honestly assess the situation at hand. It may be necessary to weigh the pros and cons of different options, gather more information, or seek guidance from others to help you make an informed decision. However, prolonged indecision can lead to stagnation, and it's important to eventually address the issue at hand. The crossed swords symbolize the need to find a balance between opposing forces and find a way to reconcile conflicting aspects.

>z
Time passes.

Future: The Lovers (reversed)
Lovers reversed indicates a breakup between partners, families or friends. Lovers reversed can also indicate a wrong choice being made. It represents disharmony and conflicts within relationships, a lack of balance, and difficult choices. In its reversed form, this card serves as a reminder to evaluate the foundations of your relationships and address any underlying issues. It urges you to explore your desires, fears, and doubts, as well as to reflect upon the consequences of your choices.

As the reading concludes, Esmeralda gazes into your eyes with a cryptic smile and delivers their final words of wisdom: "The order of things is important. Alphabetically and numerically; one follows another and provides the link between the two. If you will learn, think on this carefully. Also, don't trust Whidbey. He's up to something."

Whether you leave with a sense of wonder or unease, the encounter lingers with you - it's a touch of magic amid the bustling carnival, as if you've glimpsed something beyond the ordinary.

Ferris Wheel
The Ferris wheel dominates the carnival, its bright lights visible from every corner. Its massive steel frame arches high, with colorful gondolas swaying as it turns. At night, flashing in bursts of red, green, and white, the wheel dazzles with lights. The air buzzes with the hum of the motor. The operator calls, "Step right up! The best view of the carnival awaits!" From the top, riders get a panoramic view of the fairgrounds, with city lights stretching to the horizon.

Hey! Is that a two dollar bill on the ground?

At the peak, the carnival sprawls below, its lights twinkling against the twilight sky. The world falls quiet up here. The gondola sways gently, adding excitement to the serene view. From the top you can see something to the west of the concession stand. As you descend, the sounds of the carnival return, bringing you back to the fun.

>l at beams
The Ferris wheel towers above the carnival and is illuminated with vibrant lights, creating a dazzling display. As the wheel turns slowly, the gondolas remain upright, offering riders a thrilling yet gentle experience and spectacular views from the top.

Over the loudspeaker, an announcement blares: Attention please. There is a vehicle being towed from the parking lot for parking illegally. The license plate of the car is "862901". You breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that's not your license plate. I guess it's a good thing you remembered to place the parking stub on the dashboard.

Pitchers Mound
The milk bottle toss is a classic game of skill and luck. A pyramid of colorful bottles sits on a sturdy platform - three on the bottom, two in the middle, and one at the top.

The booth is brightly colored with red-and-white stripes, twinkling lights, and a sign reading "TOSS A DIME - WIN A PRIZE!" Prizes hang around the booth, from stuffed animals to shiny trinkets. Gleaming plates reflect the light, waiting for dimes. The "ping" of dimes hitting plates is followed by the satisfying "plop" when they land. Shouts of victory and playful groans mix with carnival music and laughter. The operator calls out, drawing in onlookers.

The "HELL RIDE" sign pulses above the door, while demon statues with clawed hands seem to beckon. The entrance is shrouded in darkness, broken only by eerie green flashes that reveal twisted paths.

Maintenance Office
The maintenance office is a dim, cluttered space, filled with the smells of grease, sweat, and popcorn. Disorganized shelves are lined with tools and parts, while paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches. A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.

A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.

Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. The floor is gritty with dust and scattered nails. Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose and keeps the carnival running, fueled by sweat and ingenuity.

Exits lead north and south.

Control Room
The backstage control room is a functional space with gray, scuffed walls. A large monitor shows live feeds while control panels with dials, buttons, and lights manage the rides and systems. The panels remain oddly dark.

The hum of electronics is interrupted by a crackling radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" Papers, tools, and coffee cups clutter the floor. A desk holds logs and schedules, and a corkboard displays charts and red-marked notes, including one that says "Check Zipper circuit breakers."

A single light casts harsh shadows, and the air smells of lubricant and burnt wires, mingling with dampness. The room is hidden but vital, keeping the carnival running. On one wall, a switch sparks with blue and white arcs.

On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.

Nearby a metal door leads east to Dark Hallway.

Currently there are sparks arcing out from the switch. It looks dangerous.

Crawl Space
The crawl space beneath the ride is cramped and dark, filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is thick with oil and rust. Sounds echo - groaning steel, clanking chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors.

The ground is uneven, a mix of dirt, gravel, and scattered tools. Pipes overhead are wrapped in fraying insulation, crackling as you move. Small puddles of murky water collect.

The backstage area continues north and south.

Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.

Mechanical Room North
The north mechanical room is compact, housing auxiliary systems for the ride. A soft hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, interrupted only by the occasional hissing of hydraulic fluid.

Circuit breaker panels line the walls, labeled for different functions. Cables and conduits connect the systems to the main hub. Flickering with gauges, a hydraulic pump in the corner manages lifting arms and platforms.

A small workbench is cluttered with parts, while shelves above hold spare parts like cables and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram with red annotations is pinned nearby. Dimly lit, the room feels cool and damp.

There are exists north and south.

Nearby an emerald colored door leads west.

You can also see a toolbox (closed) and a sledgehammer here.

Mechanical Room South
The south mechanical room is the heart of the ride, with a massive motor powering the thick belts, pulleys, and gears. Electrical panels line the walls, flashing "High Voltage" and colorful indicator lights.

Conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems. A cluttered table holds tools, spare parts, and maintenance logs stained with grease. The air smells of oil, metal, and ozone.

A cooling fan struggles to cut the warmth as the hum of machinery mixes with the hiss of hydraulics and clinking chains. The floor is a patchwork of metal grates and worn concrete. Fluorescent lights illuminate the room, where every movement is precise and controlled.

You can travel north and south from here.

Nearby a gray colored door leads west.

You can also see a grate (in which is an emerald colored fuse) here.
