Ticket Booth
The ticket kiosk stands at the carnival entrance, a compact booth painted in bright red and yellow stripes with bold letters above the window reading "Tickets Here!" Twinkling lights outline its edges, blinking rhythmically to draw attention.

A single window serves visitors, where a smiling cashier dispenses colorful tickets from neatly arranged rolls. Beside the tickets, a cash drawer jingles as change is counted, and a digital payment system glows faintly for modern convenience. Too bad you don't have a debit card.

Next to the kiosk, a vibrant signboard lists ticket prices with playful illustrations of rides. Pennant flags flutter from the kiosk's roof, adding to the festive atmosphere, while the smell of popcorn and pretzels wafts from the southwest.

The worn ground around the kiosk shows the passage of eager carnival-goers. Families, couples, and friends form a buzzing line, their excitement building as they approach this first step into the magic of the carnival.

The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. A price list for attraction tickets is on the signboard. The cashier has Hell Ride ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.

High Striker
This area features a tall, eye-catching machine adorned with bright, colorful lights, typically red, yellow, and blue. A large sign at the top reads "Test Your Strength!" in bold, playful lettering. The machine's base is made of polished wood, giving it a vintage appearance. At the center is a sturdy metal pole, with a large bell hanging at the top, signaling when a successful attempt has been made. Along the length of the pole are markings indicating how strong you are.  A nearby sign says, "Buy a mallet, strike the bell, win a prize."

Spectators gather around, cheering on participants and offering lighthearted jabs and encouragement, creating a lively, competitive atmosphere. The sound of the mallet hitting the target is followed by the resonant clang of the bell (if struck), alongside the buzz of carnival music in the background.

The Ticket Kiosk is to the west. Other games are northeast and southeast of here. The Ferris Wheel lies to the east.

You can see a Strongman attendant, a lever, and some High Striker prizes here.

Dime Toss Game
The game booth is adorned with vibrant colors - red-and-white striped awnings, twinkling lights, and eye-catching signage that reads "TOSS A DIME - WIN A PRIZE!". You can see prizes of all shapes and sizes hang around the booth, from stuffed animals and novelty toys to shiny trinkets and quirky collectibles. The larger prizes are prominently displayed to entice passersby. Rows of gleaming plates sparkle under overhead lights, their glass surfaces reflecting the surrounding glow.

The distinctive "ping" of dimes hitting plates creates a rhythmic soundtrack, punctuated by the occasional satisfying "plop" when a dime lands perfectly. Victorious shouts mix with playful groans of near-misses, creating a symphony of excitement. Nearby, the hum of other booths, upbeat carnival music, and the distant laughter of children add to the lively backdrop. The booth operator calls out enthusiastically, "Step right up! Test your skill! Win big!" Their energetic pitch draws in curious onlookers. You thought you caught a flash of something coming from the area of the booth.

Pitchers Mound
The milk bottle ball toss is a classic carnival game that combines skill, strength, and a bit of luck. The setup features a pyramid of brightly colored milk bottles stacked on a sturdy platform - three on the bottom, two in the middle, and one on top. Players stand behind a marked line and toss baseballs, aiming to knock down as many bottles as possible. Clearing the entire stack wins a prize.

The booth buzzes with energy, its colorful banners and flashing lights drawing a lively crowd. The satisfying clatter of falling bottles mixes with cheers and groans from players and spectators. A carnival attendant calls out, "Step right up and test your aim! Three balls for just a dime." Prizes - ranging from small toys to giant stuffed animals - hang prominently, enticing players to take a shot. With every toss, the game delivers moments of suspense, joy, and fun, making it a favorite at the carnival.

You're surprised to see that this game only costs a dime. The High Striker is to the northwest.

The milk bottles are stacked in three neat rows: three bottles on the bottom, two in the middle, and one on top.

Ferris Wheel
The Ferris wheel is the towering centerpiece of the carnival, its vibrant lights and graceful rotations drawing the attention of visitors from every corner of the fairgrounds. The wheel's massive steel frame arches high into the sky, its intricate network of beams glinting under the colorful glow of bulbs strung along its circumference. Each gondola, painted in bright hues like red, yellow, and blue, dangles from the wheel, swaying gently as it turns.

At night, the Ferris wheel transforms into a dazzling spectacle, with hundreds of synchronized lights creating patterns and ripples that pulse outward like waves. The bulbs flash in bursts of red, green, and white, casting playful reflections on nearby attractions and the surrounding crowd.

The air around the wheel is filled with a mix of excited chatter, the hum of its motor, and the occasional squeal of laughter or nervousness from riders high above. The ride operator, standing in a small booth at the base, keeps a steady rhythm of loading and unloading passengers, their voice occasionally calling out, "Step right up! The best view of the carnival awaits!"

The Ferris wheel offers an ever-changing perspective of the carnival below. From its peak, riders can see the entire fairground: the spinning lights of the rides, the colorful stripes of game booths, and the winding paths of visitors navigating the midway. Beyond the carnival, the view stretches to the horizon, with city lights adding to the magical experience.

Whether it's a romantic ride for couples, a thrilling adventure for friends, or a calming retreat for families, the Ferris wheel captures the spirit of the carnival - an iconic blend of excitement, wonder, and timeless charm.

Hey! Is that a two dollar bill on the ground?

You can also see a Ferris Wheel Attendant here.

>give ticket to attendant

You give the Ferris Wheel ticket to the Ferris Wheel Attendant.

As you step into the gently swaying gondola, a faint creak accompanies the safety bar locking into place. The Ferris wheel begins its slow ascent, the hum of its machinery blending with the distant sounds of carnival games and laughter below. A soft breeze brushes against your face as the gondola rises higher, offering an ever-expanding view of the fairgrounds.

With each rotation, the world transforms. At the peak, the carnival sprawls beneath you like a miniature village, its vibrant lights twinkling against the twilight sky. The sound of the midway fades into a soft murmur, replaced by the serene quiet of being high above the bustling crowd. Beyond the carnival, the horizon stretches endlessly, framed by the glow of distant city lights.

From the top you can see something to the west behind the concession stand.

The gondola sways gently, adding a hint of thrill to the tranquil ride. You exchange smiles with your companions, pointing out tiny figures darting between booths and the dizzying motion of other rides below. The Ferris wheel begins its descent, and the lively carnival sounds grow louder once again, bringing you back into the heart of the action.

Whether you're seeking a moment of calm, a romantic view, or the sheer wonder of seeing the world from above, the Ferris wheel delivers an unforgettable ride that captures the magic of the carnival.

Concession Stand
The concession stand, perched along the midway, is a colorful and bustling hub. Painted in bright reds, blues, and yellows, it features bold lettering announcing treats like "SODA! POPCORN! CANDY APPLES!" Strings of twinkling lights frame the stand, making it a glowing beacon amid the carnival excitement.

Behind the counter, a popcorn machine churns out golden kernels, filling the air with a buttery aroma. Candy apples gleam under the lights, and cotton candy machines spin fluffy clouds of pink and blue. Warm pretzels sit under a heat lamp, their buttery, salted scent mingling with the sugary treats. A cooler holds sodas, their colorful labels visible through the frosted glass.

The counter is lively with stacks of paper bags, napkins, and cups of cheese and sugar sprinkles. A handwritten chalkboard menu lists prices in playful lettering. Workers in colorful aprons quickly hand out snacks, their movements efficient amid the cheerful chaos.

In front of the stand, kids tug at their parents, teens share pretzels, and the crowd buzzes with energy. More than just a snack stop, the stand is a sensory delight, adding flavor and charm to the carnival experience.

To the south is the Carnival Office. The trailer's exterior is painted in dull, peeling shades of red and white, with old carnival advertisements that are barely legible due to sun damage. A string of dimly lit, flickering bulbs hang above the door, and an old "Private" sign is half-hanging on the side, clearly neglected.

There is a menu to the right of the window. You can see the treats inside the stand. There is an exit to the south and northeast.

The barker cries:

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round! 
Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! 
She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. 
Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids - a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and allure! 
For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!

Show Facade
You head west through the midway, the bright lights of the carnival fading behind you as you approach a tent. A sign above the entrance reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and the Unknown!" A rotund barker, wearing a fez and a dazzling smile, gestures to a small sign beside him. The Ticket Kiosk is back the way you came.

There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up and enjoy the Little Egypt Show.

You can see a Barker here.

>give dime to barker
(first taking the dime)
(putting the parking ticket into the fanny pack to make room)
You hand over a dime, and the barker nods, waving you through. As you step past the entrance, the air feels thicker, almost humid, and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now - one filled with the scents of incense and unfamiliar spices, and the low, hypnotic music of a faraway land. Before you, a series of dimly lit tents stretch out, their flaps slightly swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you take your first step into the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.

The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing you into the rhythm of unfamiliar live music played on traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands move in intricate, mesmerizing patterns, demonstrating remarkable control and fluidity. She incorporates dramatic spins, drops, and shimmies, often accentuating the beat of the music with a quick jingle of her coin belt.

Ride Entrance
The cars that will take you into the fearsome Hell Ride stop here for you to board and then move forward, the safety bar locked in place, as the entrance to Hell Ride looms ahead - a grotesque facade of twisted metal and carved wood, illuminated by flickering blood-red lights. The air carries a faint sulfuric tang mingled with the sweet aroma of carnival popcorn.

A towering archway of flames, spikes, and grinning skulls frames the entrance, crowned by flickering letters that read "HELL RIDE", pulsing like a heartbeat. Below, crouching demon sculptures extend clawed hands in a sinister invitation. Wooden doors cover the entrance, whispering with faint, menacing chuckles as distorted organ music grows louder, punctuated by shrieks and grinding machinery.

Inside, near-total darkness is broken by flashes of sickly green light revealing twisted paths and grotesque shapes. Beyond the threshold lies only uncertainty and terror. To one side, the darkness looks a little bit darker than the rest of the room.

Carousel
The carousel is a timeless carnival attraction, radiating charm and nostalgia with its brightly painted horses, vibrant lights, and cheerful music. The circular platform is adorned with a canopy of swirling colors, gold trim, and decorative mirrors that reflect the flickering bulbs lining its edges.

Rows of hand-carved animals, most often horses with flowing manes, are arranged in a circle. Each is painted in vivid colors, detailed with golden saddles and ribbons. It also features creatures like lions, tigers, and sea dragons, adding whimsy to the ride. The animals rise and fall gently as the carousel spins, mimicking a galloping motion.

The carousel's warm, playful tunes drift across the midway, inviting riders of all ages to enjoy its simple delight. Children laugh as they choose their favorite animals, while adults savor the nostalgia of the spinning ride. As it rotates, the carousel becomes a moving work of art, blending motion, color, and music into an enchanting centerpiece of the carnival. The Ticket Kiosk is back to the southwest; the way you came.

Maintenance Office
The maintenance office, hidden behind the carnival's bright facade, is a dim and cluttered space reeking of grease, sweat, and faint traces of popcorn from the midway. The air hangs heavy with oil and stirred-up dust.

The walls are lined with shelves holding tools and parts in disarray - screws and mismatched jars with faded labels. Paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches, many left half-open. In the center, a battered desk is strewn with wires, gears, and springs, a bent piece of metal held in a vise. Overhead, a single flickering fluorescent light struggles to illuminate the room.

In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism lies exposed, chains and pulleys dangling from hooks above, faintly clinking with the vibrations of the rides. A grease-stained manual and a half-drained mug of coffee sit abandoned on a nearby stool.

The walls display faded safety posters, a cork board with maintenance schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. A clock ticks faintly, its hands out of sync with reality. The floor, gritty with dust and scattered nails, adds to the room's chaotic charm.

Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose - a hidden hub where the carnival's magic is sustained through sweat, ingenuity, and the hum of machinery.

Exits lead north and south.

Control Room
The backstage control room is a plain, functional hub where the carnival's rides, lights, and attractions are managed. Gray industrial walls, scuffed and greasy, surround a large monitor streaming live carnival feeds. Beneath them, control panels with labeled dials, colored buttons, and lights oversee the systems scattered about the room. Glancing at the control panels, you can see they are dark.

The hum of electronics fills the air, punctuated by the crackle of a radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" The worn floor is scattered with papers, tools, and coffee cups. A cluttered desk holds logs and schedules, while a cork board above displays charts and red-marked notes like "Check Zipper circuit breakers."

A flickering light casts cold shadows as the metallic tang of machinery mixes with dampness. Functional yet essential, this hidden space ensures the carnival's magic runs seamlessly. On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.

A dark hallway lies to the east.

Crawl Space
The crawl space beneath the carnival ride is a tight, claustrophobic tunnel shrouded in darkness and filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is stale and heavy, carrying the sharp metallic scent of oil and the faint tang of rust. Every sound is amplified in the confined space - the groaning of steel beams, the clanking of chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors driving the ride above.

The ground is uneven, a mix of packed dirt and loose gravel scattered with forgotten tools, scraps of metal, and tangled wires. Overhead, a network of pipes crisscross the space, some wrapped in fraying insulation that crackles faintly as you crawl past. Small puddles of murky water collect in dips on the floor, their surfaces rippling with vibrations from the ride's movement.

The backstage area continues north and south.

Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.

>s

Mechanical Room North
The north mechanical room is compact and specialized, housing auxiliary systems that keep the ride running smoothly. A subdued hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, its quiet rhythm broken only by the occasional hiss of hydraulic fluid.

Circuit breaker panels line the walls, labeled for functions like "Lighting Controls" and "Brake Systems". Smaller cables and conduits snake along the walls, linking these systems to the main hub. In one corner, a hydraulic pump and reservoir manage lifting arms and rotating platforms, their gauges flickering as they work.

A small workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with tools and coiled wires, while shelves above hold neatly labeled spare parts - cables, and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram pinned nearby is marked with red annotations from past repairs.

Dimly lit by a single hanging bulb, the room feels cooler and slightly damp, the metallic tang of machinery mixing with a hint of mildew. Though quieter and less prominent than the south mechanical room, this space plays a vital role in supporting the ride's operation and ensuring its emergency systems are always prepared.

Bumper Cars
The bumper cars is a bustling hub of excitement and laughter, set beneath a canopy of flashing lights and colorful decorations. The rectangular arena is surrounded by padded barriers, ensuring a safe yet thrilling experience for riders. The floor, slick and metallic, allows the brightly colored cars - painted in shades of red, blue, yellow, and green - to glide effortlessly in all directions.

Each car is equipped with a steering wheel and a padded bumper, designed to absorb the impact of playful collisions. As the ride begins, drivers of all ages eagerly maneuver their cars, aiming for friends, family, or strangers with mischievous grins. The air is filled with the sound of bumpers colliding, laughter, and the occasional squeal of surprise.

Overhead, a web of electric poles connects the cars to the ceiling, sparking faintly as they supply power to the vehicles. The ride operator watches from a booth, ensuring everyone enjoys the chaos safely. Surrounding the bumper cars are cheering onlookers, carnival lights, and the lively hum of the fairground.

The bumper cars perfectly captures the playful spirit of the carnival, offering a mix of harmless competition, shared laughter, and nostalgic fun for all ages. The Ticket Kiosk is southeast of here.

Mechanical Room South
The south mechanical room is the operational core of the carnival ride, a bustling, noisy space dominated by a massive motor. Its steady hum drives the thick belts, pulleys, and gears that work in perfect unison to power the ride.

Heavy-duty electrical panels line the walls, adorned with warning labels like "High Voltage" and blinking indicator lights in an array of colors. Overhead, labeled conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems with meticulous precision.

A cluttered table holds tools and spare parts - bolts and lubricants - alongside open maintenance logs marked with greasy fingerprints. The air is thick with the smell of oil, metal, and a faint trace of ozone from the electrics.

A cooling fan spins in the corner, barely cutting through the room's warmth. The hum of machinery is occasionally punctuated by clinking chains and the sharp hiss of hydraulic fluid. The floor, a mix of metal grates and worn concrete, reflects years of use and maintenance.

Bright fluorescent lights in wire cages illuminate the space, highlighting the intricate systems at work. The south mechanical room is the ride's powerhouse, where every movement is controlled with precision to deliver its thrilling experience.

Generator Room
 The generator room is a compact, utilitarian space where the lifeblood of the carnival's power is produced. Its reinforced concrete walls bear grime, oil streaks, and faint graffiti from past workers. The air carries a mix of diesel, hot metal, ozone, and damp earth, creating a distinctly industrial scent.

At the center, the main generator hums steadily, its scuffed steel casing evidence of years of service. Thick rubberized cables extend from it like veins, connecting to junction boxes and circuit breakers along the walls. A large panel nearby is cluttered with buttons, switches, and gauges, many with faded labels like "Fuel Intake" and "Emergency Shutoff." A flickering display screen shows power levels and load distribution.

The rough concrete floor is uneven, marked by small puddles of spilled fuel or condensation. Shelves along the walls hold spare parts - filters, spark plugs, and wire coils - while a work area sits beside a grease canister and a worn maintenance manual.

A single industrial bulb in a protective cage casts harsh light, leaving deep shadows across the machinery. In the corner, a vent fan whirs faintly, struggling to cool the warm, vibrating air. A row of diesel canisters gleams beneath a faded safety sign that warns, "Fuel Safely - No Open Flames!"

Though isolated and utilitarian, the generator room is the carnival's heartbeat, powering its lights, rides, and sounds. Its quiet separation from the carnival's chaos serves as a stark reminder of the machinery driving the magic.

The backstage area continues north and south of here.

Electrical Room
The electrical room is a small but essential space hidden behind the carnival's bright attractions. The air vibrates with electric energy, carrying the acrid scent of overheated wires and metal. Metal panels line the walls, some polished, others worn and streaked with grease.

A central breaker panel, labeled with destinations like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors," dominates one wall. Colored indicator lights blink intermittently, reflecting off steel surfaces. Overhead, thick cable bundles snake across the ceiling, connecting to the carnival's power network.

In a corner, an open junction box spills wires onto the wall, while a workbench holds scattered tools and a smudged wiring diagram pinned above. The dirt floor bears scratches, oil stains, and wire clippings. A faint vibration, carried from the generator or nearby rides, pulses through the room.

An emergency shutdown panel painted bright red stands near a fire extinguisher and a faded safety poster. A small fan on the workbench oscillates weakly, barely cooling the room's warmth. Flickering fluorescent tubes overhead cast harsh, shifting shadows.

The electrical room is raw and utilitarian, revealing the fragile systems behind the carnival's magic - a humbling reminder of the power sustaining the midway's enchantment.

This room is eerily quiet, missing the ever present buzz of electricity. There are exits in all directions.

Storage Room
The carnival storage room is a cramped yet essential space, tucked away from the bustling grounds. Its rusted metal and peeling wooden walls bear the marks of years of use, while the air hangs heavy with grease, dust, damp canvas, and a faint trace of stale popcorn.

Shelves overflow with supplies - boxes of light bulbs, spools of wire, and assorted ride parts - piled without order. Tangled flags and strings of lights dangle from hooks, while crates labeled "GAME PRIZES" and "RIDE PARTS" hold items like stuffed animals and plastic toys. Folded tarps and tent poles teeter in one corner.

The room's center is dominated by larger objects: spare ride seats, unassembled booths, and faded attraction pieces like a scratched carousel horse, all hidden beneath protective tarps.

Near the entrance, a battered desk is cluttered with empty coffee cups. Above it, a bulletin board brims with ride schedules and repair requests. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts uneven shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere.

The floor, a rough blend of concrete and dirt, is littered with nuts and wire scraps. In the dim corners, the scuttle of rats and the glint of cobwebs underline the room's gritty nature.

Chaotic yet indispensable, this hidden space powers the carnival's magic, ensuring every ride and booth runs seamlessly.

There is an exit to the north.

Ride Exit
The exit of Hell Ride is designed to leave riders with lingering unease. Emerging from a dark corridor with peeling black and red-streaked walls, flickering lights cast erratic shadows on the uneven floor. The air is cool and damp, carrying a faint metallic tang, while faint whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.

Riders step into a small courtyard enclosed by jagged, rusted fencing draped with cobwebs and plastic skulls. Overhead, a weathered sign reads, "You've Survived? For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch silently, occasionally muttering cryptic remarks like, "Not everyone makes it out."

A merchandise display glows red, selling items like Hell Ride Survivor t-shirts and key chains. Beyond the fencing, the cheerful carnival lights and sounds feel jarring, contrasting sharply with the ride's oppressive atmosphere.

The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience - it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.

There is a price list next to the cash register. An attendant is here to assist you with your purchases. The stand has aqua colored fuse, Plastic Bones, Devil Horns, Key Chains, and T-Shirts for sale.

As you enter the room, you can see Mr Whidbey across the way. He seems to be doing something around the guillotine platform. You walk closer to see what he is doing and startle him. Mr Whidbey spins around and stares at you. As he turns and walks out of the guillotine room, you think you saw him drop something.

Guillotine Room
The public square buzzes with tense anticipation, a crowd gathered under gray skies that cast a somber light on the cobblestones. At the center, a stark wooden platform looms, its purpose grim and unavoidable.

A lone figure stands on the scaffold, bound hands behind their back and head bowed low, avoiding the crowd's gaze. Their tattered clothing, once fine, reflects the fall that led them to this moment.

The crowd encircles the platform, emotions ranging from jeers and curses to silent, grim observation. Children sit on shoulders, their curious eyes unaware of the event's gravity. Near the edge of the platform, the town crier proclaims the crime: "High treason against the crown. Let this be a warning to all who defy the realm!"

The condemned flinches but remains silent as the executioner - a hooded figure in black - stands ready beside the guillotine, its blade gleaming faintly in the dim light. The murmurs of the crowd fall into silence at the executioner's signal, leaving only the rustle of wind and the creak of the scaffold.

As the condemned approaches the guillotine, a crow caws sharply from a nearby rooftop, its cry echoing through the square like an omen. The crowd leans forward, breath held, as justice and mortality converge on the scene.

There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be seriously injured.  You're glad you're not in one of those cars now.

Dungeon
The dungeon is a dark, suffocating chamber carved into the earth, its stone walls slick with moisture and grime. The air reeks of sweat, blood, mildew, and burning oil from flickering torches mounted on rusted sconces. Shadows twist on the walls, creating grotesque, unsettling shapes in the dim light.

Chains hang from walls and ceilings, their faint clinking blending with the moans and occasional screams of prisoners. Water drips rhythmically from a cracked ceiling, adding to the chamber's eerie ambiance.

The room is littered with instruments of torment: a splintered rack, a glowing brazier holding bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair gleaming faintly in the light. Prisoners endure their own horrors - one stretched on the rack, another hanging limply from manacles, and a third gasping weakly in the spiked chair.

The hooded torturer moves with detached precision, their leather apron stained with the evidence of countless victims. They work silently, indifferent to the agony surrounding them.

Above, rats scuttle in the shadows, and the low ceiling presses down like the weight of despair. This is a realm of suffering and hopelessness, where life and death blur, and torment is the only certainty.

As you push the indigo button, the monitor switches to a view of the guillotine room. You can still see the blade rising and falling over the cars. Suddenly, you see the blade slowing down, taking longer and longer to fall. Until it finally comes to a complete rest.

The room is heavy with uneasy silence. Hell Ride, once a thrilling spectacle, now looms motionless, as the guillotine blade is frozen halfway down its track. Moments ago, chaos erupted as the malfunctioning mechanism sent the blade crashing unpredictably, ripping through the roofs of cars on the track.

A single car, its roof gashed open, sits under the still blade - a grim reminder of the disaster narrowly averted. Above, a black crow lands on the guillotine's frame, its sharp caw cutting through the murmurs of anger and fear.

Two mechanics climb the scaffolding with tools in hand, their appearance met with wary hope. A crowd has gathered and is watching, holding their breath, as the cursed ride's fate hangs in the balance.

As you exit the ride, the carnival owner and the mayor are present and extending their undying gratitude for saving the day, not to mention lives!
