Ticket Booth
Painted in bright red and yellow stripes, the ticket kiosk stands at the entrance with flickering lights to draw attention. A smiling cashier hands out tickets, while the cash drawer jingles. A digital payment system sits in the corner. Too bad you don't have a debit card.

To the right, a signboard displays ticket prices alongside illustrations of the rides. Pennant flags flutter and the air is filled with the scent of popcorn, pretzels, and grease.

The ground is worn from the steps of carnival goers eagerly waiting in line as they approach the midway.

The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. A price list for attraction tickets is on the signboard. The cashier has Hell Ride ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.

High Striker
A tall machine stands with bright red, yellow, and blue lights. A sign sits at the top reading "Test Your Strength!" The base is dark, polished wood, with a sturdy metal pole and a bell at the top. Markings along the pole indicate strength. A smaller sign says, "Buy a mallet, strike the bell, win a prize." Spectators cheer as the sound of the mallet hitting the target fills the night.

The Ticket Kiosk is to the west. Other games are northeast and southeast of here. The Ferris Wheel lies to the east.

You can see a High Striker attendant, a bullseye, and some High Striker prizes here.

The attendant is holding a mallet.

Pitchers Mound
The milk bottle toss is a classic game of skill and luck. A pyramid of colorful bottles sits on a sturdy platform - three on the bottom, two in the middle, and one at the top. Players throw baseballs to knock down the stack and win a prize. The booth is lively, with cheering and the clatter of falling bottles. The attendant calls, "Step right up! Three balls for a dime!" Prizes from toys to stuffed animals hang nearby. With this carnival favorite, every toss is filled with suspense.  You thought you caught a flash of something coming from the area of the booth.

You're surprised to see that this game only costs a dime. The High Striker is to the northwest.

The milk bottles are stacked in three neat rows: three bottles on the bottom, two in the middle, and one on top.

Dime Toss Game
The booth is brightly colored with red-and-white stripes, twinkling lights, and a sign reading "TOSS A DIME - WIN A PRIZE!" Prizes hang around the booth, from stuffed animals to shiny trinkets. Gleaming plates reflect the light, waiting for dimes. The "ping" of dimes hitting plates is followed by the satisfying "plop" when they land. Shouts of victory and playful groans mix with carnival music and laughter. The operator calls out, drawing in onlookers.

You're surprised to see that this game only costs a dime. The exit is to the southwest.

Ferris Wheel
The Ferris wheel dominates the carnival, its bright lights visible from every corner. Its massive steel frame arches high, with colorful gondolas swaying as it turns. At night, flashing in bursts of red, green, and white, the wheel dazzles with lights. The air buzzes with the hum of the motor. The operator calls, "Step right up! The best view of the carnival awaits!" From the top, riders get a panoramic view of the fairgrounds, with city lights stretching to the horizon.

Hey! Is that a two dollar bill on the ground?

You can also see a Ferris Wheel attendant here.

>give ticket to attendant
(the Ferris Wheel ticket to the Ferris Wheel attendant)
You give the Ferris Wheel ticket to the Ferris Wheel attendant.

As you enter the gondola, the safety bar clicks into place, and the Ferris wheel begins its ascent. The sounds of the carnival fade, replaced by the hum of machinery and a soft breeze. At the peak, the carnival sprawls below, its lights twinkling against the twilight sky. The world falls quiet up here. The gondola sways gently, adding excitement to the serene view. From the top you can see something to the west of the concession stand. As you descend, the sounds of the carnival return, bringing you back to the fun.

Concession Stand
The concession stand is a destination for many along the midway. Twinkling lights frame the stand making it glow amid the carnival's buzz.

Behind the counter, popcorn churns in the machine, candy apples gleam, and cotton candy spins in clouds. Warm pretzels sit under a heat lamp, while sodas chill in a frosted cooler. The counter is cluttered with bags, napkins, and sprinkle cups. Kids tug at parents, teens share pretzels, and the crowd buzzes with energy.

There is a menu to the right of the window. You can see the treats inside the stand. There are exits to the south, west, and northeast.

Carnival Office
Dim, yellow light from an overhead bulb casts long shadows over the room, A single desk lamp, flickering provides additional light. A few carnival-themed knick-knacks sit atop the desk. A framed photograph hangs askew on the wall.

The desk is covered in stacks of paperwork, old receipts, invoices, and faded carnival brochures. A locked cabinet is tucked away against one wall. Next to it, there's a small, heavy safe.

Nearby a sturdy door leads north to the Concession Stand.

In front of the tent, the barker gestures excitedly, calling out:

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather 'round! 
Step right up and witness the spectacle that's taken the world by storm! 
She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile. 
Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids - a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and allure! 
For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!

Show Facade
As you walk west through the midway, the lights fade to a soft glow, leading you to a tent. A sign reads "Little Egypt Show - A Journey Into the Mysterious and Unknown!" The barker, wearing a fez and smiling, points to another sign: "Little Egypt - Dime Admission." The ticket kiosk is behind you to the east.

There is a stage in front of the tent. The Barker is encouraging you to step up and enjoy.

You can see a Barker here.

>give dime to barker
(first taking the dime)
(putting the parking ticket into the fanny pack to make room)
You hand over a dime, and the barker nods, waving you through. As you step up to the entrance, the air feels thicker and the sounds of the carnival fade away. You've entered an entirely different world now. Before you, there is a tent. Intrigued, you take your first step towards the Little Egypt Show. You can now head west into the show.

>west



Show Tent
You are inside the Little Egypt Show. The attraction's facade is to the east. There are folding chairs standing vigil in neat in rows. The show should start soon.

The tent is dimly lit, the stage is a fully decorated representation of some Middle Eastern palace, featuring rich, colorful fabrics, brass ornaments, and lanterns casting a warm, flickering glow. Heady incense wafts through the air, softening everything around the edges. Enhancing the mystique, the backdrop displays painted scenes of pyramids, desert landscapes, and domed structures. The colorful onion topped buildings and jewel tones set to the sepia colored landscape have you transported far away.

>wait
Time passes.

Little Egypt emerges, draped in flowing silken veils. Skillfully she twirls using them as part of the dance. A sparkling, sequined bodice opens into a gauze skirt, adorned with jingling coin belts and jewelry that accentuate her dance.

>wait
Time passes.

The performance begins with slow, undulating movements, drawing you into the rhythm of the music. Traditional instruments like the oud, darbuka, or zurna are an accompanying chorus. As the tempo builds, her hips, torso, and hands twist in an intricate and mesmerizing pattern. Little Egypt demonstrates remarkable control and fluidity. She dramatically spins, drops, and shimmies, often punctuating the beat with a quick jingle of her coin belt.

Over the loudspeaker, an announcement blares: Attention please. There is a vehicle being towed from the parking lot for parking illegally. The license plate of the car is "862901". You breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that's not your license plate. I guess it's a good thing you remembered to place the parking stub on the dashboard.

>wait
Time passes.

Little Egypt makes eye contact with you and smiles enigmatically. In her performance she balances a fine silver sword on her head and accents her dance with tinkling finger cymbals.

>wait
Time passes.

The music oscillates between hauntingly slow melodies and rapid, energetic drum beats, a roller coaster of emotion that leaves you entranced. Little Egypt relies on the music's dynamic changes to tell a story with movements reflecting joy, sorrow, seduction, and celebration.

>wait
Time passes.

The performance concludes with a dramatic flourish, an energetic shimmy, a bold spin, and Little Egypt casts off her veils. The dancer takes a bow to thunderous applause, leaving you spellbound by the sensual display.

You applaud until your hands are sore. Did she just wink at you?

As she leaves the stage, Little Egypt tosses one of her veils to you!


>wait
Time passes.

>wear veil
You wrap the veil around your head, shrouding your eyes. The world is a lovely color pink as you look through the veil while her perfume fills your nostrils in the most delightful way. You look pretty!

Ride Entrance
The cars for Hell Ride stop here, and the safety bar clicks into place as riders board the cars. Ahead, the grotesque entrance looms - a twisted metal archway adorned with spikes, skulls, and flickering blood-red lights. A faint sulfuric smell mixes with the scent of popcorn.

The "HELL RIDE" sign pulses above the door, while demon statues with clawed hands seem to beckon. The entrance is shrouded in darkness, broken only by eerie green flashes that reveal twisted paths. Faint whispers and distant organ music grow louder. To one side, the darkness looks a little bit darker than the rest of the room.

You can see a Hell Ride car (empty) here.

Maintenance Office
The maintenance office is a dim, cluttered space, filled with the smells of grease, sweat, and popcorn. Disorganized shelves are lined with tools and parts, while paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches. A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.

A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.

Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. The floor is gritty with dust and scattered nails. Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose and keeps the carnival running, fueled by sweat and ingenuity.

Exits lead north and south.

Control Room
The backstage control room is a functional space with gray, scuffed walls. A large monitor shows live feeds while control panels with dials, buttons, and lights manage the rides and systems. The panels remain oddly dark.

The hum of electronics is interrupted by a crackling radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" Papers, tools, and coffee cups clutter the floor. A desk holds logs and schedules, and a corkboard displays charts and red-marked notes, including one that says "Check Zipper circuit breakers."

A single light casts harsh shadows, and the air smells of lubricant and burnt wires, mingling with dampness. The room is hidden but vital, keeping the carnival running. On one wall, a switch sparks with blue and white arcs.

On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.

Crawl Space
The crawl space beneath the ride is cramped and dark, filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is thick with oil and rust. Sounds echo - groaning steel, clanking chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors.

The ground is uneven, a mix of dirt, gravel, and scattered tools. Pipes overhead are wrapped in fraying insulation, crackling as you move. Small puddles of murky water collect.

The backstage area continues north and south.

Nearby a crimson colored door leads west.

>south

Mechanical Room North
The north mechanical room is compact, housing auxiliary systems for the ride. A soft hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, interrupted only by the occasional hissing of hydraulic fluid.

Circuit breaker panels line the walls, labeled for different functions. Cables and conduits connect the systems to the main hub. Flickering with gauges, a hydraulic pump in the corner manages lifting arms and platforms.

A small workbench is cluttered with parts, while shelves above hold spare parts like cables and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram with red annotations is pinned nearby. The room feels cool and damp.

There are exists north and south.

Bumper Cars
The bumper cars are a lively scene of flashing lights and vibrant decorations. The arena is surrounded by padded barriers, ensuring the rider's safety. Cars in faded reds, blues, yellows, and greens glide across the slick floor, each equipped with a steering wheel and padded bumper. Riders maneuver their cars with intensity, creating a din of bumps and laughter. Overhead, electric poles hum with energy. While onlookers cheer from the sidelines, the bumper cars offer playful competition and nostalgic fun for all. The Ticket Kiosk is southeast of here.

You can see a Bumper Cars attendant here.

Which prize would you like? 1) a teddy bear, 3) a magenta colored fuse, 4) a poster of Taylor Swift?

Mechanical Room South
The south mechanical room is the heart of the ride, with a massive motor powering the thick belts, pulleys, and gears. Electrical panels line the walls, flashing "High Voltage" and colorful indicator lights.

Conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems. A cluttered table holds tools, spare parts, and maintenance logs stained with grease. The air smells of oil, metal, and ozone.

A cooling fan struggles to cut the warmth as the hum of machinery mixes with the hiss of hydraulics and clinking chains. The floor is a patchwork of metal grates and worn concrete. The room is busy; every movement is precise and controlled.

Generator Room
The generator room is small, with concrete walls stained by oil and grime. The air smells of diesel, metal, and damp earth.

The main generator hums, connected by thick cables to circuit breakers and a cluttered panel with switches and gauges. A flickering display shows power levels. The cracked floor is littered with puddles. Shelves hold spare parts and manuals, and a workbench sits next to a grease canister.

The room is the carnival's power source, hidden but essential.

The backstage area continues north and south of here.

Nearby an indigo colored door leads west.

>south

Electrical Room
The electrical room is small, hidden behind the carnival's attractions. The air smells of overheated wires and metal.

A central breaker panel dominates one wall, with labels like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors." Indicator lights blink intermittently. Thick cables hang from the ceiling, connected to the carnival's power network.

A junction box spills wires, and a workbench holds tools and a smudged wiring diagram. The floor is scratched and stained. A faint vibration pulses in the air.

An emergency shutdown panel and fire extinguisher sit nearby. Fluorescent lights cast shifting shadows. The room is raw and essential, a behind-the-scenes look at the carnival's power.

This room is eerily quiet, missing the ever present buzz of electricity. There are exits in all directions.

Storage Room
The storage room is cramped and hidden, with rusted walls and peeling wood. The air smells of dust, damp canvas, and stale popcorn.

Shelves are packed with light bulbs, wire, and old ride parts. Flags, lights, and crates of toys clutter the space. In one corner, tarps and tent poles are stacked.

Spare ride seats and an old carousel horse sit under tarps in the center. A cluttered desk holds schedules and coffee cups, with a bulletin board full of flyers.

The concrete floor is littered with scraps and dirt. Rats scurry and cobwebs move. This forgotten room stores the remnants of the carnival, waiting to be revived.

There is an exit to the north.

Nearby a khaki colored door leads west.

Ride Exit
The exit of Hell Ride leaves you unsettled. You emerge from a dark corridor, the walls peeling and streaked with black and red. Flickering lights cast shifting shadows on the sloped floor, and the air is damp with a metallic tang. Whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.

In a small courtyard, a rusted fence draped with cobwebs and plastic bones encloses the area. A worn sign reads, "You've Survived? For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch quietly, muttering, "Not everyone makes it out."

The nearby gift shop glows red. The bright lights and sounds of the carnival feel distant and jarring after the oppressive atmosphere of the ride.

The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience - it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.

There is a price list next to the cash register. An attendant is here to assist you with your purchases. The stand has aqua colored fuse, Plastic Bones, Devil Horns, Key Chains, and T-Shirts for sale.

As you enter the room, you can see Mr Whidbey across the way. He seems to be doing something around the guillotine platform. You walk closer to see what he is doing and startle him. Mr Whidbey spins around and glares at you. As he turns and walks out of the room, you think you saw him drop something.

Guillotine Room
The public square hums with tension under gray skies. A wooden platform stands at the center, a grim focal point.

A lone figure, hands bound and head bowed, stands on the scaffold. Their tattered clothes reveal a once-gilded past.

The crowd jeers while children watch wide-eyed. The town crier proclaims, "High treason against the crown!"

The condemned remains silent as the executioner, robed in black, stands beside the guillotine. The blade gleams in the dim light. The crowd's murmurs die, replaced by silence.

As the condemned approaches, the guillotine's timing falters. Instead of falling on the scaffold, the blade swings over the cars, threatening any unlucky passenger who passes beneath.

There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be seriously injured.

You're glad you're not in one of those cars now. You must do something to stop it before someone gets hurt!

Dungeon
The dungeon is dark and damp, the air thick with sweat, blood, and mildew. Lanterns flicker on rusted sconces, casting twisted shadows.

Chains rattle, mixed with distant moans and screams. Water drips from a cracked ceiling, pooling on the blood-dark floor.

Instruments of torture clutter the room: a broken rack, a brazier with bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair. Prisoners endure all these things, bound or writhing in agony.

The torturer moves with cold precision, ignoring the suffering. Above, rats scurry in the shadows, and the heavy, oppressive air thickens with despair.

Nearby a wooden door leads east to the Mechanical Room South.

The monitor flickers for a second and the scene it displays changes to something different.
The monitor now shows a tableau of a guillotine rising and falling over the ride exit.
The indigo light is now on.

As you push the indigo button, the monitor switches to a view of the guillotine room. You still see the blade rising and falling over the cars. Suddenly, the blade starts slowing down, taking longer and longer to fall. Until it finally comes to a complete rest.

The room is heavy with uneasy silence. Hell Ride, once a thrilling spectacle, now looms motionless, as the guillotine blade is frozen halfway down its track. Moments ago, chaos erupted as the malfunctioning mechanism sent the blade crashing unpredictably, ripping through the roofs of cars on the track.

A single car, its roof gashed open, sits under the still blade - a grim reminder of the disaster narrowly averted. Above, a black crow lands on the guillotine's frame, its sharp caw cutting through the murmurs of anger and fear.

Two mechanics climb the scaffolding with tools in hand, their appearance met with wary hope. A crowd has gathered and is watching, holding their breath, as the cursed ride's fate hangs in the balance. After a moment, applause rises from the assembled crowd, cheering your accomplishment.

Mr. Whidbey, the Mayor, the Chief of Police, and the janitor arrive on the scene and extend their gratitude for saving the day, not to mention lives!

"But wait", you say, "There is more afoot here than meets the eye. I think we need to talk to Mr Whidbey some more... confront him about a few things. Accusations might be made."

Mr Whidbey exclaims, "Accusations? What accusations?

The Police Chief listens with interest to what you have to say.

>look
Control Room
The backstage control room is a functional space with gray, scuffed walls. A large monitor shows live feeds while control panels with dials, buttons, and lights manage the rides and systems. The panels are lit.

The hum of electronics is interrupted by a crackling radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" Papers, tools, and coffee cups clutter the floor. A desk holds logs and schedules, and a corkboard displays charts and red-marked notes, including one that says "Check Zipper circuit breakers."

A single light casts harsh shadows, and the air smells of lubricant and burnt wires, mingling with dampness. The room is hidden but vital, keeping the carnival running. On one wall, a switch sparks with blue and white arcs.

On one wall is a large switch.

Nearby a metal door leads east to Dark Hallway.

You can also see a janitor, Mayor, Chief of Police, Mr Whidbey, and a big switch here.

Mr Whidbey nervously shifts his weight from one foot to the other.

"Ok, I guess you got me. The carnival was losing money and we were going to go out of business. I was desperate to turn things around.

Then that Needleman kid got hurt on the bumper cars. We filed an insurance claim for it. When he got paid, Needleman asked if we could get more and split it.

It seemed like a good idea at the time. I could get some extra cash to pay the carnival's bills. Then the thought of the money got overwhelming and I thought, "What if there was a fire and the estimate for repairs was, let's shall we say, generous. We could take the extra money, pay bills, and pocket the rest.

The Chief of Police pays particular attention to Mr. Whidbey's confession. He approaches Whidbey and says "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney during interrogation; if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you."

He handcuffs Whidbey, thanks you for your service to the community, and leads Mr Whidbey away to jail.
