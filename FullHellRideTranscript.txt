Parking Lot
The lot stretches across an open field, gravel crunching under the tires of arriving cars. Floodlights and the carnival's colorful glow light the area, accompanied by distant laughter, music, and the hum of rides.

Cars park haphazardly, guided by makeshift signs and fluttering flags. Families and visitors mingle, some lingering in vehicles, preparing for the chilly evening ahead. Shadows from encroaching trees are pierced by the occasional flash of a flashlight. At the entrance, an attendant collects fees in a weathered booth, making change from a cash box.

Puddles from recent rain shimmer under the lights, while patches of mud cling to shoes. In the distance, RVs and trailers sit quietly, their occupants watching the Ferris wheel turn against the evening sky. The lot serves as a transition between the mundane and the magical world inside the carnival.

The midway is to the south. There is a blueberry bush here. There are blueberries on the bush.

Your car is here. It's a bit of a beater. Inside the car, you can see the glove box, the seat, the rear view mirror, the ignition, and the dashboard.

The attendant has a parking ticket. The price of a parking is $5.00.

Ticket Booth
Painted in bright red and yellow stripes, the ticket kiosk stands at the entrance with flickering lights to draw attention. A smiling cashier hands out tickets, while the cash drawer jingles. A digital payment system sits in the corner. Too bad you don't have a debit card.

To the right, a signboard displays ticket prices alongside illustrations of the rides. Pennant flags flutter and the air is filled with the scent of popcorn, pretzels, and grease.

The ground is worn from the steps of carnival goers eagerly waiting in line as they approach the midway.

The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. A price list for attraction tickets is on the signboard. The cashier has Hell Ride ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, Ferris Wheel ticket, Bumper Cars ticket, and Carousel ticket.

Carousel
The carousel radiates charm with its brightly painted horses, lights, and calliope music. The platform features a canopy of colors and decorative mirrors. Hand-carved animals, including horses, lions, tigers, and sea dragons, circle as the carousel spins. The animals rise and fall gently, adding to the charm. The music rises from the Carousel inviting riders of all ages to enjoy this most basic symbol of the carnival.

The Ticket Kiosk is back to the southwest; the way you came.

Stepping onto the carousel, you're surrounded by colorful beasts, glittering lights, and carved details.

Gripping the pole, you settle into the saddle as the carousel begins to spin.

As it speeds up, the world blurs in a swirl of colors, and the gentle rise and fall mimics a playful gallop. Laughter mixes with the music, creating a nostalgic atmosphere.

As the ride slows, you step off smiling, the music still echoing in your ears, and return to the bustling carnival.

Concession Stand
The concession stand is a destination for many along the midway. Twinkling lights frame the stand making it glow amid the carnival's buzz.

Behind the counter, popcorn churns in the machine, candy apples gleam, and cotton candy spins in clouds. Warm pretzels sit under a heat lamp, while sodas chill in a frosted cooler. The counter is cluttered with bags, napkins, and sprinkle cups. Kids tug at parents, teens share pretzels, and the crowd buzzes with energy.

There is a menu to the right of the window. You can see the treats inside the stand. There are exits to the south and northeast.

Nearby a sturdy door leads south.

Bumper Cars
The bumper cars are a lively scene of flashing lights and vibrant decorations. The arena is surrounded by padded barriers, ensuring the rider's safety. Cars in faded reds, blues, yellows, and greens glide across the slick floor, each equipped with a steering wheel and padded bumper. Riders maneuver their cars with intensity, creating a din of bumps and laughter. Overhead, electric poles hum with energy. While onlookers cheer from the sidelines, the bumper cars offer playful competition and nostalgic fun for all. The Ticket Kiosk is southeast of here.

Fortune Teller
Approaching the fortune teller's booth, you are drawn in by its mysterious allure and inky softness. Draped in deep purple curtains adorned with golden moons and stars, the booth is lit only with the flickering of candles. The air is heavy with the scent of incense, mingling with and then overpowering the ever-present sugary odor of carnival treats. A sign sways slightly in the evening breeze.

You can see Esmeralda here.

Over the loudspeaker, an announcement blares: Attention please. There is a vehicle being towed from the parking lot for parking illegally. The license plate of the car is "862901". You breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that's not your license plate. I guess it's a good thing you remembered to place the parking stub on the dashboard.

>listen
You can hear all the sounds of the carnival. The sounds of a calliope waft across the thoroughfare from the carousel. You can hear the laughter and screams as other patrons ride the rides and play the games.

>l at esmeralda
The fortune teller sits in a dimly lit booth, draped in rich fabrics of deep purple and gold adorned with celestial patterns of stars and moons.

Stepping inside, you're greeted by Esmeralda, a figure cloaked in flowing robes with a jeweled headpiece catching the flickering light. Her piercing eyes seem to look right through you as they gesture for you to sit at a small round table. At its center rests a glowing crystal ball, surrounded by tarot cards and mysterious trinkets.

Esmeralda's voice is low and melodic, weaving an air of intrigue as they ask you to focus on a question and offer you a tarot reading. The room seems to shrink, the bustling carnival outside fading into the background as she reveals your fate. Each card turned feels significant, as though unlocking a secret you didn't know you carried.

Past: Ten of Wands (upright)
Ten of Wands suggests that you may be shouldering too many responsibilities or taking on more than you can handle. You may feel overwhelmed, exhausted, or weighed down by the tasks and obligations in your life. This card serves as a reminder to evaluate your commitments and consider whether you need to delegate, seek support, or let go of some burdens.

>z
Time passes.

Present: Nine of Wands (upright)
Nine of Wands is the card for strength, courage, resilience and endurance. Never give up and never surrender. It suggests that while you may be tired or worn out from the struggles you've faced, it's important to remain alert and prepared for any further challenges that may arise. This card encourages you to draw upon your past experiences and learn from them, using them as sources of wisdom and guidance.

>z
Time passes.

Challenge: The World (upright)
World is the final Major Arcana card and represents fulfillment and successful completion of a cycle. You know your place in the world, and your life lessons have served you well. It serves as a gentle reminder that the universe is aligning perfectly in your favor, propelling you forward towards the triumphant realization of your ambitions. The world is at your feet. You're on the right path towards the attainment of your long-cherished aspirations and dreams.

>z
Time passes.

Opportunity: Two of Swords (reversed)
Two of Swords reversed suggests that poor choices and hasty decision-making are likely to lead to movement in the wrong direction. It serves as a reminder that impulsive actions can often result in unfavorable outcomes, urging you to carefully consider your options and approach situations with thoughtfulness and patience. By taking the time to weigh your choices and make deliberate decisions, you can avoid the pitfalls that come with rushing into action without considering the potential consequences.

>z
Time passes.

Future: Four of Wands (reversed)
Four of Wands reversed indicates the foundation not laid or not ready. Something has caused a disruption in your plans. This could be due to external factors, such as unexpected events that have thrown you off course. Alternatively, it could be self-sabotage, your wavering self-belief or lack of confidence in your abilities can be hindering you from achieving your goals.

As the reading concludes, Esmeralda gazes into your eyes with a cryptic smile and delivers their final words of wisdom: "The order of things is important. Alphabetically and numerically; one follows another and provides the link between the two. If you will learn, think on this carefully. Also, don't trust Whidbey. He's up to something."

Whether you leave with a sense of wonder or unease, the encounter lingers with you - it's a touch of magic amid the bustling carnival, as if you've glimpsed something beyond the ordinary.

Ferris Wheel
The Ferris wheel dominates the carnival, its bright lights visible from every corner. Its massive steel frame arches high, with colorful gondolas swaying as it turns. At night, flashing in bursts of red, green, and white, the wheel dazzles with lights. The air buzzes with the hum of the motor. The operator calls, "Step right up! The best view of the carnival awaits!" From the top, riders get a panoramic view of the fairgrounds, with city lights stretching to the horizon.

Hey! Is that a two dollar bill on the ground?

The booth is brightly colored with red-and-white stripes, twinkling lights, and a sign reading "TOSS A DIME - WIN A PRIZE!" Prizes hang around the booth, from stuffed animals to shiny trinkets. Gleaming plates reflect the light, waiting for dimes. The "ping" of dimes hitting plates is followed by the satisfying "plop" when they land. Shouts of victory and playful groans mix with carnival music and laughter. The operator calls out, drawing in onlookers.

Behold the one, the only Little Egypt, performing her legendary Dance of the Pyramids - a dazzling display of mystery, grace, and allure! 
For just a dime, a mere one tenth of a dollar, prepare to be transported to the sands of Cairo, where enchantment and wonder await!

Ticket Booth
Painted in bright red and yellow stripes, the ticket kiosk stands at the entrance with flickering lights to draw attention. A smiling cashier hands out tickets, while the cash drawer jingles. A digital payment system sits in the corner. Too bad you don't have a debit card.

To the right, a signboard displays ticket prices alongside illustrations of the rides. Pennant flags flutter and the air is filled with the scent of popcorn, pretzels, and grease.

The ground is worn from the steps of carnival goers eagerly waiting in line as they approach the midway.

The midway continues in all directions from here. There is a cashier here. A price list for attraction tickets is on the signboard. The cashier has Ferris Wheel ticket, Fortune Teller ticket, and Carousel ticket.

Ride Entrance
The cars for Hell Ride stop here, and the safety bar clicks into place as riders board the cars. Ahead, the grotesque entrance looms - a twisted metal archway adorned with spikes, skulls, and flickering blood-red lights. A faint sulfuric smell mixes with the scent of popcorn.

The "HELL RIDE" sign pulses above the door, while demon statues with clawed hands seem to beckon. The entrance is shrouded in darkness, broken only by eerie green flashes that reveal twisted paths. Faint whispers and distant organ music grow louder. To one side, the darkness looks a little bit darker than the rest of the room.

Maintenance Office
The maintenance office is a dim, cluttered space, filled with the smells of grease, sweat, and popcorn. Disorganized shelves are lined with tools and parts, while paint cans and grease jars clutter the workbenches. A battered desk holds wires, gears, and springs, with a bent piece of metal in a vise.

A flickering fluorescent light barely brightens the room. In one corner, a disassembled ride mechanism hangs with chains and pulleys. A greasy manual and a half-empty coffee mug sit on a nearby stool.

Faded safety posters and a worn photo of the carnival decorate the walls, along with a corkboard full of schedules and notes, and a worn photo of the carnival in its prime. The floor is gritty with dust and scattered nails. Despite the mess, the room buzzes with purpose and keeps the carnival running, fueled by sweat and ingenuity.

Control Room
The backstage control room is a functional space with gray, scuffed walls. A large monitor shows live feeds while control panels with dials, buttons, and lights manage the rides and systems. The panels remain oddly dark.

The hum of electronics is interrupted by a crackling radio: "Maintenance to Bumper Cars - wrench needed!" Papers, tools, and coffee cups clutter the floor. A desk holds logs and schedules, and a corkboard displays charts and red-marked notes, including one that says "Check Zipper circuit breakers."

A single light casts harsh shadows, and the air smells of lubricant and burnt wires, mingling with dampness. The room is hidden but vital, keeping the carnival running. On one wall, a switch sparks with blue and white arcs.

On one wall is a large switch with sparks arcing out from it.

Crawl Space
The crawl space beneath the ride is cramped and dark, filled with the hum of machinery above. The air is thick with oil and rust. Sounds echo - groaning steel, clanking chains, and the rhythmic thrum of motors.

The ground is uneven, a mix of dirt, gravel, and scattered tools. Pipes overhead are wrapped in fraying insulation, crackling as you move. Small puddles of murky water collect.

The backstage area continues north and south.

Mechanical Room North
The north mechanical room is compact, housing auxiliary systems for the ride. A soft hum of capacitors and relays fills the space, interrupted only by the occasional hissing of hydraulic fluid.

Circuit breaker panels line the walls, labeled for different functions. Cables and conduits connect the systems to the main hub. Flickering with gauges, a hydraulic pump in the corner manages lifting arms and platforms.

A small workbench is cluttered with parts, while shelves above hold spare parts like cables and hydraulic tubing. A faded ride diagram with red annotations is pinned nearby. The room feels cool and damp.

The south mechanical room is the heart of the ride, with a massive motor powering the thick belts, pulleys, and gears. Electrical panels line the walls, flashing "High Voltage" and colorful indicator lights.

Conduits and wires snake across the ceiling, connecting systems. A cluttered table holds tools, spare parts, and maintenance logs stained with grease. The air smells of oil, metal, and ozone.

A cooling fan struggles to cut the warmth as the hum of machinery mixes with the hiss of hydraulics and clinking chains. The floor is a patchwork of metal grates and worn concrete. The room is busy; every movement is precise and controlled.

A central breaker panel dominates one wall, with labels like "Ferris Wheel Lights" and "Carousel Motors." Indicator lights blink intermittently. Thick cables hang from the ceiling, connected to the carnival's power network.

A junction box spills wires, and a workbench holds tools and a smudged wiring diagram. The floor is scratched and stained. A faint vibration pulses in the air.

An emergency shutdown panel and fire extinguisher sit nearby. Fluorescent lights cast shifting shadows. The room is raw and essential, a behind-the-scenes look at the carnival's power.

Shelves are packed with light bulbs, wire, and old ride parts. Flags, lights, and crates of toys clutter the space. In one corner, tarps and tent poles are stacked.

Spare ride seats and an old carousel horse sit under tarps in the center. A cluttered desk holds schedules and coffee cups, with a bulletin board full of flyers.

The concrete floor is littered with scraps and dirt. Rats scurry and cobwebs move. This forgotten room stores the remnants of the carnival, waiting to be revived.

There is an exit to the north.

Nearby a khaki colored door leads west.

Ride Exit
The exit of Hell Ride leaves you unsettled. You emerge from a dark corridor, the walls peeling and streaked with black and red. Flickering lights cast shifting shadows on the sloped floor, and the air is damp with a metallic tang. Whispers and distant screams echo softly in the background.

In a small courtyard, a rusted fence draped with cobwebs and plastic bones encloses the area. A worn sign reads, "You've Survived? For Now." Nearby, carnival workers in tattered costumes watch quietly, muttering, "Not everyone makes it out."

The nearby gift shop glows red. The bright lights and sounds of the carnival feel distant and jarring after the oppressive atmosphere of the ride.

The exit ensures Hell Ride isn't just an experience - it lingers, blurring the line between thrill and fear.

There is a price list next to the cash register. An attendant is here to assist you with your purchases. The stand has aqua colored fuse, Plastic Bones, Devil Horns, Key Chains, and T-Shirts for sale.

Nearby a wooden door leads east to the Storage Room.

As you enter the room, you can see Mr Whidbey across the way. He seems to be doing something around the guillotine platform. You walk closer to see what he is doing and startle him. Mr Whidbey spins around and glares at you. As he turns and walks out of the room, you think you saw him drop something.

Guillotine Room
The public square hums with tension under gray skies. A wooden platform stands at the center, a grim focal point.

A lone figure, hands bound and head bowed, stands on the scaffold. Their tattered clothes reveal a once-gilded past.

The crowd jeers while children watch wide-eyed. The town crier proclaims, "High treason against the crown!"

The condemned remains silent as the executioner, robed in black, stands beside the guillotine. The blade gleams in the dim light. The crowd's murmurs die, replaced by silence.

As the condemned approaches, the guillotine's timing falters. Instead of falling on the scaffold, the blade swings over the cars, threatening any unlucky passenger who passes beneath.

There is just one problem: the guillotine is being raised and lowered by some mechanism. It appears that the timing of the guillotine is off and it is being lowered onto the cars instead of between them. If a person were to be in a car as it passed under the guillotine, they would be seriously injured.

You're glad you're not in one of those cars now. You must do something to stop it before someone gets hurt! 

Nearby a wooden door leads east to the Generator Room.

Dungeon
The dungeon is dark and damp, the air thick with sweat, blood, and mildew. Lanterns flicker on rusted sconces, casting twisted shadows.

Chains rattle, mixed with distant moans and screams. Water drips from a cracked ceiling, pooling on the blood-dark floor.

Instruments of torture clutter the room: a broken rack, a brazier with bloodstained tools, and a spiked chair. Prisoners endure all these things, bound or writhing in agony.

The torturer moves with cold precision, ignoring the suffering. Above, rats scurry in the shadows, and the heavy, oppressive air thickens with despair.

Stake Room
The public square is silent, broken only by crackling flames. At its center, three women are bound to wooden stakes, their faces showing defiance, resignation, and terror.

A crowd watches, some jeering, others praying or looking away. Torch in hand, the executioner steps forward igniting the pyre. Flames roar as the women cry out, their voices lost in the heat.

Gray clouds loom above as a raven caws. Church bells toll, marking the tragedy. Some onlookers stay, others quietly leave.

Gallows Room
The public square, wet from morning drizzle, lies under a dark sky. At its center, the gallows loom, ropes swaying. Their eyes fixed on the scene, the crowd stands in silence.

A hooded executioner, cold and focused, adjusts the noose. Pale and bound, the condemned man trembles as his eyes dart around the crowd. Sweat and rain mix on his face as he breathes shallowly.

Vendors shout, children push forward, and an old man whispers prayers. Above, the bell tolls, marking the man's final moments. A raven watches from the gallows beam. The air is heavy as distant thunder rumbles.

Nearby a wooden door leads east to the Crawl Space.

As you push the indigo button, the monitor switches to a view of the guillotine room. You still see the blade rising and falling over the cars. Suddenly, the blade starts slowing down, taking longer and longer to fall. Until it finally comes to a complete rest.

The room is heavy with uneasy silence. Hell Ride, once a thrilling spectacle, now looms motionless, as the guillotine blade is frozen halfway down its track. Moments ago, chaos erupted as the malfunctioning mechanism sent the blade crashing unpredictably, ripping through the roofs of cars on the track.

A single car, its roof gashed open, sits under the still blade - a grim reminder of the disaster narrowly averted. Above, a black crow lands on the guillotine's frame, its sharp caw cutting through the murmurs of anger and fear.

Two mechanics climb the scaffolding with tools in hand, their appearance met with wary hope. A crowd has gathered and is watching, holding their breath, as the cursed ride's fate hangs in the balance. After a moment, applause rises from the assembled crowd, cheering your accomplishment.

Mr. Whidbey, the Mayor, the Chief of Police, and the janitor arrive on the scene and extend their gratitude for saving the day, not to mention lives!

"But wait", you say, "There is more afoot here than meets the eye. I think we need to talk to Mr Whidbey some more... confront him about a few things. Accusations might be made."

Mr Whidbey exclaims, "Accusations? What accusations?"

The Police Chief listens with interest to what you have to say.

"Hell Ride is a finicky ride. I'm fixing something there every week. Last week, Mr. Whidbey asked me to skip Hell Ride's maintenance slot. There was a real fire in the Stakes Room last month. And just yesterday I caught him creeping around the guillotine room" says the janitor.

>accuse whidbey of insurance fraud
Mr Whidbey nervously shifts his weight from one foot to the other.

"Ok, I guess you got me. The carnival was losing money and we were going to go out of business. I was desperate to turn things around.

Then that Needleman kid got hurt on the bumper cars. We filed an insurance claim for it. When he got paid, Needleman asked if we could get more and split it.

It seemed like a good idea at the time. I could get some extra cash to pay the carnival's bills. Then the thought of the money got overwhelming and I thought, "What if there was a fire and the estimate for repairs was, let's shall we say, generous. We could take the extra money, pay bills, and pocket the rest.

The Chief of Police pays particular attention to Mr. Whidbey's confession. He approaches Whidbey and says "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney during interrogation; if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you."

He handcuffs Whidbey, thanks you for your service to the community, and leads Mr Whidbey away to jail.
